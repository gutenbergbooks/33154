<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> popular exhibitions of the speaking-telephone
during the past six months, together with
numerous newspaper articles, have created a widespread
interest in the instrument; and it has been
thought that a small book explanatory of its
action would meet a public want.</p>

<p>It has seemed to be necessary to call attention
to the various phenomena and inter-actions of
the forces involved; and hence the author has
attempted to make plain and intelligible the
phenomena of electricity, magnetism, and sound.
Cuts have been inserted where they could be useful
in making the mechanical conditions more intelligible;
and a table of tone-composition has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
devised, which shows at a glance the constituents
of the sounds of various musical instruments.</p>

<p>As the speaking-telephone, in which magneto-electric
currents were utilized for the transmission
of speech and other kinds of sounds, was invented
by me, I have described at some length my first
instrument, and have also given explicit directions
for making a speaking-telephone which I know, by
trial, to be as efficient as any hitherto made; but
nothing in the book is to be taken as a dedication
of the invention to the public, as steps have already
been taken to secure letters-patent according to the
laws of the United States.</p>

<h2>THE TELEPHONE.</h2>


<h2>ELECTRICITY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the phenomena of electricity are manifested
upon so large a scale as to be thrust upon
the attention of everybody. Thus lightning, which
accompanies so many showers in warm weather
in almost every latitude, has always excited in
some individuals a superstitious awe, as being an
exhibition of supernatural agency; and probably
every one feels more or less dread of it during a
thunder-shower, and this for the reason that it
affects so many of the senses at the same time.
The flash may be blinding to the eyes if near to
us; the thunder may be deafening to the ears, and
so powerful as to shake the foundations of the
hills, and make the ground upon which we stand
to sensibly move: these with the remembered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
destructive effects that have been witnessed,
of buildings demolished and large trees torn to
splinters in an instant, are quite sufficient to
raise a feeling of dread in the strongest mind.
In the polar regions, both north and south, where
thunder-storms are less frequent, the atmospheric
electricity assumes the form called the aurora
borealis, or the aurora australis, according as it is
seen north or south of the equator.</p>

<p>More than two thousand years ago it was noticed
by the Greeks that a certain kind of a mineral
which was thrown up on the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea, when rubbed would attract
light bodies, such as shreds of silk or linen and
bits of paper. To this substance they gave the
name of Elektron, and the property developed
thus by friction was afterwards called electricity.
In 1600 Dr. Gilbert, physician to Queen Elizabeth,
published a book in which he described numerous
experiments demonstrating that electricity could
be developed by friction upon a great variety of
substances, such as stones, gems, and resins. The
first machine for developing electricity was made
by Otto von Guericke of Magdeburg, about 1680.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
His machine consisted of a ball of sulphur about
six inches in diameter, which could be rotated.
If the dry hand were held against the sulphur
while it was being turned in a dark room, the
sphere appeared to emit light: it also gave out
a peculiar hissing or crackling sound. Newton
experimented a little with electricity, and noticed
that the rubber was an important element in
developing electricity. He does not seem to
have given to the subject the same attention that
he gave to some other departments of science.
Had he done so, it is probable that he would have
advanced the study a hundred years; that is to
say, he would probably have left it at the place
where it actually was in 1790. So great were his
abilities that in one lifetime he made greater
additions to human knowledge than all the rest
of mankind had made during the preceding
thousand years. In the month of June, 1752,
Franklin made that memorable experiment which
immortalized him. He flew his kite to the thunder-cloud,
practically asking the question of the
lightning whether or not it was identical with
electricity. The lightning came down the wetted
twine to his hand, and proclaimed its identity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>For the next forty years the natural philosophers
in both Europe and America only rung the
changes upon what was known. They flew kites
to the clouds; they made and charged Leyden
jars, and discharged them through wires and
chains and circuits of clasped hands, and studied
the attractions and repulsions manifested by electrified
bodies; but they added nothing of importance
in the way of experiments.</p>

<p>In 1791 Galvani, a professor of anatomy at
Bologna, announced a manifestation of electricity
that was new and of a remarkable character,
having its origin in the muscles of animals, and
so was called animal electricity. He had some
frogs' legs prepared for eating; by chance they
were placed near an electrical machine with which
Galvani was experimenting, so that a spark would
occasionally pass to the legs, when they would
contract as often as a spark passed to them. The
motion was first observed by his wife, who called
his attention to the phenomenon; and he very
soon discovered that the thighs of a frog, skinned
and suspended, made a very good electroscope.
While experimenting in this way he made another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and more important discovery; namely, that,
when the muscles and nerves of the frog's leg
were touched by pieces of two different metals,
the leg would contract as before. Alexander
Volta, another Italian professor, who had invented
the electrophorus, and was possessed of great
experimental skill, now turned his attention to
the experiment of Galvani, and very soon discovered
that the origin of the electricity that moved
the frogs' legs was not in the legs themselves, but
in the metals used. The first form of the galvanic
battery was the result of Volta's investigations,
and was called the Voltaic pile. This pile
consisted of alternate disks of zinc, flannel, and
copper, piled one on top of the other in constant
succession in that order. The flannel was moistened
with salt and water, or with diluted sulphuric
acid. When the first zinc was connected
with the last copper by means of a wire, a powerful
current of electricity was obtained. This
form of battery is not in use at all now, as much
more efficient means are known for producing
electricity; but this in 1800, when it was first
made known in England, was very startling, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was one of those surprises which have been so
frequent since then in the history of electricity.</p>

<p>Surprising things were done by Sir Humphry
Davy, with a large Voltaic battery. Water was
decomposed, and the metals potassium and sodium
were first separated from their compounds
with oxygen. Bonaparte had offered a prize of
sixty thousand francs "to the person who by his
experiments and discoveries should advance the
knowledge of electricity and galvanism as much
as Franklin and Volta did," and of "three thousand
francs for the best experiments which should
be made in each year on the galvanic fluid."
This latter prize was awarded to Davy.</p>

<p>After Davy's successes in 1806, there was
nothing of importance in an experimental way
added to the knowledge of electricity, until 1820,
when Oersted of Copenhagen announced that
"the conducting wire of a Voltaic circuit acts
upon a magnetic needle," and that the needle
tends to set itself at right angles to the wire.
This was a kind of action altogether unexpected.
This observation was of the utmost importance;
and at once the philosophers in Europe and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
America set themselves to inquire into the new
phenomenon. The laws of the motion of the
magnetic needle when acted upon by a current
of electricity traversing a wire were successfully
investigated by M. Amp&egrave;re of the French
Academy. He observed that whenever a wire
through which a current of electricity was passing
was held over and parallel with a magnetic needle
which was free to move, and therefore pointed to
the north, if the current was moving <i>towards</i> the
north, the north pole was deflected to the west; if
the current was moving towards the south, the
south pole of the magnet was deflected towards
the west; and that in all cases the magnet tended
to set itself at right angles to the current; also
that this angular displacement depended upon the
strength of the current. Thus originated the
<i>galvanometer</i>, an instrument that not only detects
the existence of an electric current, but enables
us to determine its direction and its strength.
Our present knowledge of electrical laws is due,
in a very large measure, to observations made
with this instrument. Of course it has been very
much modified, and made almost incredibly sensitive:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
yet, in all galvanometers, the fundamental
principle involved in their structure is that of the
action of a current of electricity upon a magnet,
which was first noticed by Oersted.</p>


<h3>MAGNETS.</h3>

<p>It is related by Nicander that among the shepherds
who tended their flocks upon the sides of
Mount Ida was one named Magnes, who noticed,
that, while taking his herds to pasture, his shepherd's
crook adhered to some of the rocks. From
this man's name some have supposed the name
<i>magnet</i> to have been derived. It is, however,
generally believed to have received its name from
the ancient city of Magnesia in Asia Minor, near
which the loadstone or magnetic substance was
found. This rock, which possesses the remarkable
property of attracting and holding to itself
small pieces of iron or steel, is now known to be
one of the ores of iron, and is called magnetite
by mineralogists. The iron is chemically combined
with oxygen, and forms 72.5 per cent of its
weight. There is another ore of iron, known as
hematite, which contains seventy per cent of iron;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
but the difference of two and a half per cent of
iron in the ore is enough to make the difference
between a magnetically inert substance, and one
which may be able to lift a mass of iron equal to
many times its own weight.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton is said to have worn in a
finger-ring a small loadstone weighing three
grains, which would lift seven hundred and fifty
grains, which is equal to two hundred and fifty
times its own weight. The most powerful magnet
now known is owned by M. Obelliane of Paris.
It can lift forty times its own weight. Large
pieces, however, do not support proportionally
greater weights, seldom more than one or two
times their own weight.</p>

<p>There are in many places in the world immense
beds of magnetic iron-ore. Such are to
be found in the Adirondack region in Northern
New York, and in Chester County, Pennsylvania.
The celebrated iron-mines of Sweden consist of
it, and in Lapland there are several large mountains
of it. It must not be inferred, that, because
the mineral is called magnetite, all specimens
possess the property called magnetism. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
large masses seldom manifest any such force, any
more than ordinary pieces of iron or steel manifest
it: yet any of it will be attracted by a magnet
in the same way as iron will be. The most
powerful native magnets are found in Siberia,
and in the Hartz, a range of mountains in
Northern Germany.</p>

<p>When a piece of this magnetically endowed
ore is placed in a mass of iron-filings, it will be
seen that the filings adhere to it in greatest
quantity upon two opposite ends or sides, and
these are named the poles of the magnet. If the
piece be suspended by a string so as to turn
freely, it will invariably come to rest with the
same pole turned towards the north; and this
pole is therefore called the north pole of the
magnet, and the action is called the directive
action. This directive action was known to the
Chinese more than three thousand years ago.
In traversing those vast steppes of Tartary they
employed magnetic cars, in which was the figure
of a man, whose movable, outstretched arm
always pointed to the south. Dr. Gilbert affirms
that the compass was brought from China to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Italy in 1260, by a traveller named Paulus
Venetus.</p>

<p>When a piece of hardened steel is rubbed upon
a natural magnet, it acquires the same directive
property; and, as the steel could be easily shaped
into a convenient form for use, a steel needle has
generally been used for the needle of a compass.
The directive power of the magnet has
been and still is of incalculable value to all
civilized nations. Ocean navigation would be impossible
without it, and territorial boundaries are
fixed by means of it; but there are other <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'propererties'">properties</ins>
and relations of a magnet, which have been
discovered within the last fifty years, which are
destined to be as important to mankind as that
of the compass has been.</p>

<p>In 1825 William Sturgeon of Woolwich, Eng.,
discovered that if a copper wire were wound
around a piece of soft iron, and a current of
electricity sent through the wire, the soft iron
would become a magnet, but would retain its
magnetism no longer than while the current of
electricity was passing through the coil. The
magnetism developed in this way was called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
electro-magnetism, and the iron so wound was
called an electro-magnet. The first electro-magnet
was made by winding bare wire upon the
soft iron. This method will not produce very
strong magnets. In 1830 Prof. Henry insulated
the wire by covering it with silk, and was the first
to produce powerful magnets.</p>

<p>On a soft iron bar of fifty-nine pounds weight
he used twenty-six coils of wire, thirteen on each
leg, all joined to a common conductor by their
opposite ends, and having an aggregate length of
seven hundred and twenty-eight feet. This
apparatus was found able to sustain a weight of
twenty-five hundred pounds. This electro-magnet
is now owned by Yale College.</p>

<p>The power of the electro-magnet is enormously
greater than that of any permanent magnet. A
permanent magnet made by Jamin of Paris,
which is made up of many strips of thin steel
bound together, and weighing four pounds, is able
to support a weight of one hundred pounds; but
Dr. Joule made an electro-magnet, by arranging
the coils to advantage, that would support thirty-five
hundred times its own weight, or one hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and forty times the proportionate load of Sir
Isaac Newton's ring magnet.</p>


<h3>THE GALVANIC BATTERY.</h3>

<p>The original form of the galvanic battery as
devised by Volta, and modified but little during
thirty years, consisted of a cell to contain a fluid,
which was usually dilute sulphuric acid, in which
two plates of different metals were immersed: the
metals used were generally plates of zinc and
copper, or zinc and silver. Such plates, when
first placed in the liquid, will give a very good
current of electricity; but it will not last long.
The reason of this is easy to understand. Whenever
a current of electricity is generated by
chemical action of a liquid upon two different
metals, there is always some decomposition of
the liquid, and this decomposition takes place
upon the plates themselves; and the liberated
gases <i>adhere to the plates, and prevent further
contact with the acid;</i> at the same time, the
gases themselves act upon the plates, and generate
a current of electricity in the opposite direction.
This will of course interfere with the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
current; and very soon the battery is useless until
the plates have been withdrawn from the liquid.
This physico-chemical process that takes place
in such a battery is called the <i>polarization of the
plates</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 268px;"><a name="Fig_1" id="Fig_1"></a>
<img src="images/i-001.png" width="268" height="350" alt="FIG. 1." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>The accompanying figure will help one to understand
the actions
going on in a battery
cell of the kind mentioned.
Let Pt represent
a plate of
platinum, and Zn a
plate of zinc, both
placed in a vessel
containing hydrochloric
acid, which
is also represented
by the symbols HCl.
As such molecules are extremely minute, there
will of course be an immense number of them
between the plates. The plates are now to be
connected by a wire running between them
through the air. As soon as these conditions are
fulfilled, a hissing sound will be heard coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from the cell, and bubbles of gas will be seen to
rise from the platinum plate: these bubbles prove
upon analysis to be bubbles of hydrogen. At the
same time the zinc will begin to dissolve, forming
what proves by analysis to be the chloride of zinc;
and at the same time a current of electricity travels
through the wire from the platinum to the zinc.
The quantity of electricity that is thus generated
is strictly proportionate to the quantity of hydrogen
liberated, which is also proportionate to the
weight of zinc dissolved; and this, in turn, is proportionate
to the surface of the metals exposed to
the action of the acid. Now, it happens under
such circumstances as the above, that the liberated
hydrogen adheres very strongly to the platinum,
as there is nothing for it to unite with
chemically; and therefore the plate will very
soon be visibly covered with bubbles, which may
be scraped off with a feather or a swab, but only
to have the same thing repeated.</p>

<p>This coating of bubbles will prevent the acid
from touching the plate, and so practically diminishes
the surface of it; but the quantity of
electricity generated being proportionate to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
surface exposed to the chemical action, it will be
understood at once how such polarization of the
plates must soon bring the battery to a standstill.</p>

<p>In 1836 Prof. J. F. Daniell of London contrived
a battery, which has been called the Daniell Cell,
in which the metal (copper) that had the hydrogen
liberated upon it was separated by a porous
cell from the zinc. The zinc was immersed in
dilute sulphuric acid, and the copper in an acid
solution of blue vitriol (copper sulphate). The
porous cup did not prevent the electricity from
passing, nor the decomposition from taking place;
but the hydrogen, which in this case would have
been liberated at the copper plate, at once united
with oxygen there, which it got by decomposing
the copper sulphate: hence water was formed,
and copper was deposited upon the copper plate;
and, being an excellent conductor, the battery
would keep up a strong action for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. Grove, also of London, in 1839 invented
a battery which still goes by his name, in which
the hydrogen plate is of platinum immersed in
strong nitric acid, enclosed also in a porous
earthen cell; and this, in turn, is plunged into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a vessel containing dilute sulphuric acid and the
zinc. In this case the liberated hydrogen immediately
decomposes the nitric acid, which
readily parts with its oxygen; water is the product,
as in the other case, and the nitric acid
loses strength. Strips of carbon have been substituted
for the platinum, and this is called the
Bunsen battery. It is otherwise like the Grove
battery; it gives a very powerful and constant
current and it is by the use of one or the other
of these batteries, that most of the experiments in
electricity are performed in institutions of learning,
and, until lately, most in use for telegraphic
purposes.</p>

<h2>OTHER MEANS FOR GENERATING ELECTRICITY.</h2>


<h3>THERMO-ELECTRICITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> two strips of different metals, such as silver
and iron, be soldered together at one end, and
the other ends be connected with a galvanometer,
on heating the soldered junction of the metals it
will be found that a current of electricity traverses
the circuit from the iron to the silver. If
other metals be used, having the same size, and
the same degree of heat be applied, the current
of electricity thus generated will give a greater or
a less deflection, which will be constant for the
metals employed. The two metals generally
employed are bismuth and antimony, in bars
about an inch long and an eighth of an inch
square. These are soldered together in series so
as to present for faces the ends of the bars, and
these often number as many as fifty pairs. Such
a series is called a thermo-pile. This method of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
generating electricity was discovered by Seebeck
of Berlin in 1821, but the thermo-pile so much in
use now in heat investigations was invented by
Nobili in 1835. The strength of this current is
not very great, a single Daniell cell being equal
to nine pairs of the strongest combination yet
discovered, namely, the artificial sulphuret of
copper with German silver.</p>


<h3>MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY.</h3>

<span class="caption">FIG. 2.</span>
</div>

<p>It has already been mentioned, that Oersted
found that a magnet when free to turn tended to
set itself at right angles to a wire in which a
current of electricity was passing, thus demonstrating
some inter-action between electricity and
magnetism; but it remained for Faraday to discover
the converse fact, namely, that a magnet
moving across a wire, the ends of which were connected
with a galvanometer or otherwise closed,
originated a current of electricity in the wire, the
direction of which depended upon the direction
of the movement of the magnet. If the wire was
coiled into a hollow helix, the magnet in moving
through the helix moved across, that is, at right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
angles to all the turns of the helix; and each
complete turn added to the intensity of the current.
This will be understood by reference to
the diagram, Fig. <a href="#Fig_2">2</a>. Let G be a galvanometer
connected with the wires from a helix; N S, a
permanent bar magnet. If the magnet be thrust
into the coil, a current of electricity will traverse
the helix, wire, and
galvanometer, and the
needle will indicate its
direction. If the magnet
be now withdrawn,
a current will move in
the opposite direction
through the whole circuit.
The electricity
that is thus originated
is said to be induced. The quantity of electricity
that can be induced thus is almost unlimited,
depending upon the size and strength of the
magnet, the size of the wire, and the length of
wire in the coil. There are now many forms of
machines for developing electricity from the motion
of coils of wire in front of the poles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
permanent magnets. They are generally called
magneto-electric machines. The action involved
in these machines is so important in its bearing
upon telephony as to necessitate a fuller description
of them.</p>


<h3>MAGNETIC INDUCTION.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;"><a name="Fig_3" id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i-003.png" width="417" height="300" alt="FIG. 3." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 3.</span>
</div>

<p>Let N S, Fig. <a href="#Fig_3">3</a>, be a bar of hardened steel rendered
permanently magnetic. If now there be
brought near to it a board-nail, the latter will
become a magnet through the <i>inductive</i> action of
the first magnet. This induced magnetism may
be demonstrated by bringing a tack or other bit of
iron to the end that is farthest from the permanent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
magnet; the tack will adhere to the nail, but will
fall off when the nail is removed from the neighborhood
of the magnet. By testing the polarity
of the nail, it will be found that the end nearest
the magnet will be a south pole if the magnet has
its north pole towards it, in all cases having a
polarity opposite to that of the pole acting upon
it. The strength of this induced magnetism thus
developed depends upon the distance apart of
the magnet and the iron, being at its maximum
when the two touch. But the tack itself is also
made a magnet, and will attract another tack, and
that one still another, the number which can be
thus supported being dependent upon the strength
of the first or inducing magnet.</p>

<p>Suppose now that we should wind a few feet
of wire about the nail, and fasten the two ends
of the wire to an ordinary galvanometer, and
then make the nail to approach the permanent
magnet. The galvanometer needle would be
seen to move as the nail approached; and, if the
latter were allowed to touch the magnet, the
movement of the needle would suddenly be much
hastened, but would directly come to rest, showing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that, so long as there is no motion of the
nail towards or away from the magnet, no electricity
is moving in the wire, although the nail is
a strong magnet while it is in contact with the
permanent magnet. If the nail be now withdrawn,
the two phenomena happen as before:
that is to say, as the nail recedes it loses its
magnetism; and the giving-up of its magnetism
induces a current of electricity through the wire
in the opposite direction to that it had when the
nail approached. The current of electricity in
the opposite direction is indicated by the galvanometer
needle, which moves according to Amp&egrave;re's
law mentioned on a preceding page.</p>

<p>It may be noted here that we have an effect
quite analogous to that already mentioned on page
21 as the experiment of Faraday. In one case a
permanent magnet is thrust into a coil of wire,
and in the other a piece of iron is made a magnet
while enclosed in a coil. In each case there is
generated a current of electricity <i>which lasts no
longer than the mechanical motion of the parts
lasts</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<h3>MAGNETO-ELECTRIC MACHINES.</h3>

<p>Such transient currents are practically useless,
and several devices have been invented to make
the flow continuous. The common form of machine
for doing this may be understood by reference
to the diagram.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 398px;"><a name="Fig_4" id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i-004.png" width="398" height="275" alt="FIG. 4." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 4.</span>
</div>

<p>N S, Fig. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a>, is the permanent magnet, which is
bent into a U form in order to utilize both poles.
N&acute; and S&acute; are short rods of soft iron fastened into
a yoke-piece Y, also of soft iron. Coils of wire
surround each of the rods as represented, the ends
of the wires connecting with each other and with
what is called a pole-changer. The whole of this
part is capable of revolving upon an axis P Y by
a pulley at P. The action is as follows: From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
their position, the soft-iron rods N&acute; S&acute; must be
magnets through the inductive action of the permanent
magnet, just as the nail was made a magnet
in like position. So long as the parts have
the relative position shown in the figure, and
there is no motion, no electricity can be developed;
but, if the axis P Y be turned, S&acute;, which
represents the polarity of the rod opposite N, will
be losing its induced magnetism; and, when half
a revolution has been made, that same pole will
be where N&acute; now is; but it will then have N&acute;
polarity instead of S&acute;; that is, it has been losing
south polarity as it receded from N, and gaining
north polarity as it approached S: hence a
current of electricity has steadily been flowing
through the coil in one direction. At the same
time, the other rod N&acute; has passed through similar
phases; and its enveloping coil has had a current
of electricity induced in it in the same direction
as in the first coil. This doubles the intensity
of the current; and the whole is conducted
by the connecting-wires where the current is
wanted. Machines have been built upon this
plan, that contained fifty or sixty powerful compound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
permanent magnets, and as many wire
coils, needing a steam-engine of eight or ten
horse-power to run them.</p>

<p>A less cumbersome and much more efficient
magneto-electric machine has been made by
changing the form of the soft iron armature to
something like a shuttle, and winding the wire
inside of it. This is called the "Siemen's Armature."
The latest pattern of such machines is
known as the <i>Gramme;</i> and its peculiarity consists
in the substitution of a broad ring of soft
iron for the armature. About this ring a good
many coils, of equal lengths, of insulated copper
wire are wound in such a manner that one-half
of any turn in the wire goes through the inside of
the ring, making the coils longitudinal. The
whole of the armature thus prepared is fixed upon
a shaft, so as to permit rotation, and fixed between
the poles of a powerful Jamin magnet.
The ends of the coils are connected with conductors
upon the axis; and, when the armature
thus constructed is rotated, a very constant and
powerful current of electricity flows in a single
direction, unlike the other forms. It is stated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that, with one-horse power, a light can be obtained
equal to that from a battery of fifty Grove cells.</p>


<h3>SECONDARY CURRENTS.</h3>

<p>So long ago as 1836 it was noticed by Prof.
Page of Salem, that, whenever a current of electricity
was made to flow in a coil of wire, another
current in the opposite direction was induced in
a coil that was parallel with the first; and also,
when the current in the first was broken, another
current in the second coil would flow in the opposite
direction to the former one. These currents,
which are called secondary currents, are very
transient. No current at all flows save at the
instant of making or breaking the current. In
this respect, we are reminded of the behavior of
the soft iron within the coil, which gives origin
to a current of electricity when it is made to
approach a magnet or recede from it, but gives
no current so long as it is still.</p>

<p>These secondary currents were investigated by
Prof. Henry, resulting in the discovery of many
curious and interesting phenomena. It will be
sufficient here for me to refer to what are called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
induction coils, which are developments of the
principles involved in electro-magnetism and electro-induction.
Imagine a rod of soft iron of any
size to be wound with a coil of wire, the ends of
the wire to be so left that they may be connected
with a galvanic battery. Around this coil let
another coil be wound of very fine and well-insulated
wire; the terminal wires of it to be left
adjustable to any distance from each other.
Now, upon making connection with a battery to
the primary coil, there will be two results produced
simultaneously. First, the soft iron will
be rendered magnetic; and, second, a current
of electricity will be generated in the secondary
coil; and the strength of this secondary current
is very much increased by the inductive action of
the soft iron that has been made a magnet.
When the battery current is broken, the iron
loses its magnetism, and a current of electricity
is again started in the secondary coil in the
opposite direction. The energy of this derived
current is so great that it will jump some distance
through the air, and thus is apparently
unlike the electricity that originates in a battery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
An induction coil made by Mr. Ritchie for the
Stevens Institute at Hoboken, N.J., has a primary
coil of 195 feet of No. 6 wire. The secondary
coil is over fifty miles in length, and is made
of No. 36 wire, which is but .005 of an inch in
diameter. This instrument has given a spark
twenty-one inches in length, with three large
cells of a bichromate battery.</p>

<p>Mr. Spottiswood of London has just had completed
for him the largest induction coil ever
made. It has two primary coils, one containing
sixty-seven pounds of wire, and the other eighty-four
pounds, the wire being .096 inch in diameter.
The secondary coil is two hundred and eighty
miles long, and has 381,850 turns. This coil is
made in three parts, the diameter of the wire in
the first part being .0095 inch; of the second
part, .015; and the third part, .011. With five
Grove cells this induction coil has given a spark
forty-two inches long, and has perforated glass
three inches thick.</p>

<p>The electricity thus developed in secondary
coils is of the same character as that developed
by friction; and all of the experiments usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
performed with the latter may be repeated with
the former, many of them being greatly heightened
in beauty and interest. Such, for instance,
are the discharges in vacuo in Geisler tubes,
exhibiting stratifications, fluorescence, phosphorescence,
the production of ozone in great quantity,
decomposition of chemical compounds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The electricity developed by friction upon
glass, wax, resin, and other so-called non-conductors,
has heretofore been called static electricity,
for the reason that when it was once
originated upon a surface it would remain upon
it for an indefinite time, or until some conducting
body touched it, and thus gave it a way of escape.
Thus, a cake of wax if rubbed with a piece of
flannel, or struck with a cat-skin or a fox-tail
becomes highly electrified, and in a dry atmosphere
will remain so for months. Common air has,
however, always a notable quantity of moisture
in it; and, as water is a conductor of electricity,
such damp air moving over the electrified surface
will carry off very soon all the electricity.</p>

<p>Again, the electricity developed through chemical
action in a battery and through the inter-action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of magnets and coils of wire has been called
dynamic electricity, inasmuch as it never appeared
to exist save when it was in motion in a completed
circuit. This, however, is not true; for if one of
the wires from a galvanic battery be connected
with the earth, and the other wire be attached
to a delicate electrometer, it will be found that the
latter gives evidence of electrical excitement in
the same manner as it does for the electricity
developed by friction in another body. This is
sometimes called <i>tension</i>, and is very slight for a
single cell; but in a series of cells it becomes
noticeable in other ways. Thus when the terminals
of a single cell are taken in the hands, no
effect is perceived: if, however, the terminals of
a battery consisting of forty or fifty cells be thus
taken, a decided shock is felt, not to be compared
though with the shock that would be felt from the
discharge of a very small Leyden jar. The shock
from several hundred cells would be very dangerous.</p>

<p>It was formerly doubted that the electricity
would pass between the terminals of a battery
without actual contact of the terminals. Gassiot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
first showed that the spark would jump between
the wires of a battery of a large number of cells
before actual contact was made. Latterly Mr. De
La Rue has been measuring the distance across
which the spark would jump, using a battery of
a large number of cells.</p>

<p>I give his table as taken from the "Proceedings
of the Royal Society:"&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Cells and striking distance">
<tr><td align='center'>Cells.</td><td align='center' colspan='2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Striking distance.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>600</td><td align='right'>&nbsp;.0033</td><td align='left'>&nbsp;inch.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>1,200</td><td align='right'>.0130</td><td align='center'>"</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>1,800</td><td align='right'>.0345</td><td align='center'>"</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'>2,400</td><td align='right'>.0535</td><td align='center'>"</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>This table shows that the striking distance is
very nearly as the square of the number of cells.
Thus, with 600 cells the spark jumped .0033 inch;
and with double the number of cells, 1,200, the
spark jumped .0130 inch, or within .0002 of an
inch as far as four times the first distance.</p>

<p>This leads one to ask how big a battery would
be needed to give a spark of any given length,
say like a flash of lightning. One cell would
give a spark .00000001 inch long, and a hundred
thousand would give a spark 92 inches long. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
million cells would give a spark 764 feet long,
a veritable flash of lightning. It is hardly probable
that so many as a million cells will ever be
made into one connected battery, but it is not
improbable that a hundred thousand cells may
be. De La Rue has since completed 8,040 cells,
and finds that the striking distance of that number
is 0.345 inch, a little more than one-third of
an inch. He also states that the striking distance
increases faster than the above indicated
ratio, as determined by experimenting with a still
larger number of cells.</p>

<p>These experiments and many others show that
there is no essential difference between the so-called
static and dynamic electricity. In the one
case it is developed upon a surface which has
such a molecular character that it cannot be conducted
away, every surface molecule being practically
a little battery cell with one terminal free
in the air, so that when a proper conductor
approaches the surface it receives the electricity
from millions of cells, and therefore becomes
strongly electrified so that a spark may at once
be drawn from it.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS ELECTRICITY?</h2>


<h3>THEORIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Numerous</span> attempts have been made to explain
the phenomena of electricity. As a general
thing, these phenomena are so utterly unlike
other phenomena that have been explained and
are easily intelligible, that it has quite generally
been taken for granted, until lately, that something
very different from ordinary matter and the
laws of forces applicable to it must be involved
in the phenomena themselves. Consequently
the term <i>imponderable</i> was applied to it,&mdash;something
that was matter minus some of the essentials
of matter; and as it was apparent that,
whatever it was, it moved, apparently flowed, from
one place to another, the term <i>fluid</i> was applied to
it, a term descriptive of a certain form of matter.
Imponderable fluid was the descriptive name
applied to electricity. Newton supposed that an
excited body emitted such a fluid that could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
penetrate glass. When the two facts of electrical
attraction and repulsion had to be accounted for,
two theories were propounded,&mdash;one by Benjamin
Franklin, the other by Dufay. Franklin
supposed that electricity was a subtle, imponderable
fluid, of which all bodies contained a certain
normal quantity. By friction or otherwise this
normal quantity was disturbed. If a body received
more than its due share, it was said to be
positively electrified: if it had less than its normal
quantity, it was said to be negatively electrified.
Franklin supposed this electric fluid to be highly
self-repulsive, and that it powerfully attracted the
particles of matter.</p>

<p>According to Dufay, there are two electric
fluids, opposite in tendency but equal in amount.
When associated together in equal quantities,
they neutralize each other completely. A portion
of this neutral compound fluid pervades all
matter in its unexcited state. By friction or
otherwise this compound fluid is decomposed, the
rubber and the body rubbed exchanging equal
quantities of opposite kinds with each other, leaving
one of them positively, the other negatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
electrified. These two fluids were supposed to
be self-repulsive, but to attract each other: so
that, if two bodies be charged with either positive
or negative electricity, such bodies would <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'muturally'">mutually</ins>
repel each other; but if one was charged
with positive, while the other was charged with
negative electricity, the two bodies would mutually
attract each other.</p>

<p>Either of these two theories may be used to
illustrate the phenomena, and so have done good
service in systematizing the facts. It is evident
that both of them cannot be true, and it is in the
highest degree probable that neither of them is
true.</p>

<p>Some have supposed that there was a kind of
electric atmosphere about every atom of matter;
and still another theory, now advocated by Edlund
of Stockholm, assumes that electricity is
identical with the ether by which radiant energy,
light and heat, is transmitted.</p>

<p>Before a correct judgment can be formed of
the nature of any force, it is necessary to know
what it can do, what kind of phenomena it can
produce. Let us, then, take a brief survey of
what electricity can do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>1st, It can directly produce <i>motion</i>, through the
attractions and repulsions of electrified bodies,&mdash;as
indicated by electrometers, the rotation of
the fly-wheel, the deflection of the galvanometer
needle. It has been proved by the mathematical
labors of Clausius, and confirmed by experiment,
that, when electricity performs any mechanical
work, so much electricity is lost, annihilated as
electricity.</p>

<p>2d, It can directly produce <i>heat</i>, as shown by
passing a sufficient quantity of electricity through
a fine platinum wire: the wire becomes heated,
and glows, and it may even be fused by the
intensity of the heat. The heat developed in
the so-called electric arc is so great as to fuse
the most refractory substances. If a current of
electricity from a battery be sent through a
thermo-pile, one of the faces of the pile will be
heated. The heat of the spark from a Leyden jar
may be made to ignite gunpowder, and dissipate
gold into vapor. The heat produced by lightning
is seen when a live tree is struck by a
powerful flash: the sap of the tree is instantly
converted into steam of so high a tension as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
explode the tree, scattering it in small fragments
over a wide area. The tips of lightning-rods
often exhibit this heating effect, being fused by
the passage of too great a quantity of electricity.</p>

<p>In the early part of the present century it was
demonstrated by Count Rumford, and also by
Sir Humphry Davy, that heat was but a form of
molecular motion. Since then the exact relations
between the motion of a mass of matter
and the equivalent heat have been experimentally
determined by Joule, so that the unit of heat
may be expressed in the motion of a mass of
matter. This is deducible from a more general
law, known as the conservation of energy. The
application in this place is, that whenever heat
appears through electric action, as in the above-mentioned
places, we know that it still is only
<i>motion</i> that is the product, only that this motion
is now among the molecules of the body, instead
of the motion of the whole body in space, as
when a pith-ball moves, or a galvanometer-needle
turns.</p>

<p>3d, It can directly produce <i>light</i>. This is seen
in every spark from an electric machine, in the
flash of lightning, and in the electric light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been shown in numberless ways, that
there is no essential difference between light and
heat, and that what we call light is only the
active relation which certain rays of radiant
energy have to the eyes. In order to make this
plain, suppose that a beam of light, say from the
sun, be permitted to fall upon a triangular prism
of glass: at once it is seen that the beam is
deflected, and instead of appearing a spot of
white light, as it did before it was deflected, it
now appears as a brilliant band of colors, which
is called the solar spectrum. If now this spectrum
be examined as to the distribution of heat,
by moving a thermo-pile through it from the blue
end towards the red end, it will be noticed that
the galvanometer-needle will be but slightly deflected
at the blue end; but, as the thermo-pile is
moved, the deflections are greater until it is past
the red end, where the heat is greatest. On this
account it has been customary to say that the red
end of the spectrum was the heating end. With
various pieces of mechanism the rays may be
separated from each other, and measured; and
then it appears that a red ray of light has a wave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
length of about 1/37000 in., and the violet ray
about 1/60000 in. The rays beyond the red have
also been measured, and found to be greater in
length uniformly as one recedes from the visible
part of the spectrum.</p>

<p>In like manner, beyond the blue end the wave
lengths become shorter and shorter; and in each
of these directions the spectrum that is invisible
is much longer than the visible one. Now, it has
also been found that where a prism of glass or
other material is used to produce a spectrum, it
distributes the rays very unevenly; that is,
towards the red end of the spectrum they are
very much crowded, while towards the blue end
they are more dispersed. Hence, if one were
measuring the heating power of such a spectrum,
many more rays would fall upon an equal
surface of the thermo-pile at the red end than at
the blue end; therefore the indications of the
galvanometer would be fallacious. Before any
thing definite could be known about the matter,
it would plainly be necessary to work with an
equal dispersion of all the rays. This was
effected a few years ago by Dr. Draper of New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
York. He took the spectrum produced by
diffraction instead of refraction, and measured
that. In that way it was found that the heating
power of the spectrum is equal in every part of
it; and hence the pictures in treatises on physics
that represent the heating power of the spectrum
to be concentrated at the red end is not true
save where the spectrum is irregularly produced.
As for vision, the mechanical structure of the eye
is such that radiant vibrations having a wave
length between 1/37000 in. and 1/60000 in. can affect
it, while longer or shorter wave lengths can not.
Such waves we call light, but it is not at all improbable
that some animals and insects have
eyes adapted to either longer or shorter wave-lengths;
in which case, what would be perfectly
dark to us would be light to them. It is a familiar
enough fact, that many animals, such as
dogs, cats, rats, and mice, can see in the night.
Some horses may be trusted to keep in the road
in a dark night, when the driver cannot see even
the horse itself. This has usually been accounted
for by saying that their eyes are constructed so
as to collect a greater number of luminous rays.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
It is much better explained by supposing their
eyes to be constructed to respond to wave-lengths
either greater or less than those of mankind.</p>

<p>A ray of light, then, consists of a single line of
undulations of a definite wave length, such that
if it falls upon the eye it will produce sight; if it
falls upon a thermo-pile it heats it by just the
same quantity that another wave-length would
heat it; if it falls upon matter in unstable chemical
relations, it will do chemical work, depending
upon the kinds of matter. A red ray is as effective
for some substances as a violet ray is for
others. The statement, then, so often lately made
to do certain analogical work, namely, that a ray
of light consists of three distinct parts, which may
be separated from each other, and are called heat,
light, and chemical properties, is simply untrue.
What a ray will do, depends upon what kind of a
structure it falls on; and when it has done that
work, of whatever kind it may be, it ceases to
exist as a ray.</p>

<p>If, therefore, electricity can directly produce
light, it is simply producing <i>motion</i>, as in the case
of heat, the motion being of such a sort that the
eyes of men are affected by it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>4th, It can produce <i>magnetism</i>. A current of
electricity passing through a coil of wire makes
such a coil a magnet, which will set itself in the
direction of the magnetic meridian of the earth;
and, if a bar of soft iron be placed in the coil, it
becomes the familiar electro-magnet; and, if hardened
steel be put in it, it becomes a permanent
magnet.</p>

<p>This leads to the inquiry as to what magnetism
is. We know that it can produce motion by its
moving at a distance a piece of iron or another
magnet. It will also sustain a mass of matter
against gravity or some other contrary force.
Through such mechanism as magneto-electric
machines it produces electricity in great abundance,
which again can be used to produce any
of the effects of electricity,&mdash;moving bodies by
attraction or repulsion, generating heat or light,
or again making a magnet. But as all of these
are but varied forms of motion, either of a mass
as a whole, or molecular, can it be doubted
for an instant, that what we call magnetism
is but some form of motion? Must it not be
either some form of matter, or some form of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
motion? If it were a form of matter, then a
magnet would only be permanent so long as it
was not used; for use implies consumption of the
force; and, if this be matter in any form, then in
a given mass of matter there can be but a definite
quantity of such magnetic matter, and consumption
must lessen that quantity. As a matter
of fact, there is no perceptible lessening of the
power of a magnet when it is properly used. It
is also a matter of fact, that neither motion of a
mass, nor electrical effects, nor any other, can be
produced by the action of a magnet alone. It is
only when some form of motion has been added
to its own property, that we get any kind of an
effect from it: hence all effects due to its action
are <i>resultants</i> of two forces, one of them being
common motion of a mass of matter, and the
other the energy of the magnet. Hence we infer
that a magnet is a mechanism of such a structure
as to change the direction and character of the
motion which acts upon it. When the wheel of
a common electrical machine is turned, the product
is electricity,&mdash;a force very different from
that which originates it. Ordinary mechanical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
motion <i>goes in;</i> electricity <i>comes out</i>, the latter
being a modified motion due to the physical
structure of the machine. In like manner, a
magnet may be considered as a machine by
means of which mechanical motion may be converted
into some other form of motion. It is
evident that molecular structure is chiefly concerned
in this. If a bar of iron that exhibits no
evidence of magnetism whatever be subjected to
torsion, it will immediately become a magnet
with poles dependent upon the direction of the
twist. This developed magnetism will re-act
upon a coil of wire, and so move a galvanometer
needle. If the bar be permitted to recover its
original condition, it will lose its magnetism,
which will at once re-appear upon twisting the
rod again. Now, when the rod is twisted, it is
evident that there is a molecular strain in certain
directions throughout the mass. The converse
experiment illustrates the same thing.
It has been found, that when a rod of iron is
made magnetic by the action of a current of
electricity circulating about it, and at the same
time passing longitudinally through it, the rod is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
slightly lengthened and twisted in a direction
that depends upon the direction of the current.
Moreover, if a permanent magnet be heated to
a red heat, its magnetism is destroyed; for such
a heat allows the molecules to freely arrange
themselves without any external constraint.
Also, if a permanent magnet be suspended so as
to give out a musical sound when it is struck,
the magnetism will be much weakened by making
it thus to vibrate. In this case, as in the
other, the vibrations affect every molecule, and
so enable them to re-adjust themselves to the
positions they held before being magnetized.
The same thing happens when a bar of iron is
made magnetic through the inductive action of
the earth. When this bar is held in the direction
of the magnetic dip, it becomes but very slightly
magnetized; but, if it be so held that when it is
struck with a hammer it will ring, that is, give
out a musical sound, it will at once become decidedly
magnetic. Evidently the earth's action
tends to set the molecules of the mass in a new
position, but cohesion prevents them from assuming
it. When the molecules are made to vibrate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they can assume such new positions more readily.
The molecules of a magnet, then, are differently
arranged from those in an unmagnetized piece
of iron or steel; and, for every new arrangement
of the molecules of a mass of any kind, we always
have some new physical property developed.
The same identical substance may appear as
charcoal, coke, plumbago, anthracite coal, and
diamond. Hence a magnet is a machine in
which other forces acting upon it are transformed
in character, and re-appear as attractions
and repulsions of other kinds of matter: this
transformation cannot take place, and hence
magnetism cannot become apparent, only upon
the condition of another force acting in concert
with it; and, if at any time it may seem to be
acting without such external force, it is done at
the expense of the heat it has absorbed, and
therefore the magnet must at such time be losing
temperature proportional to the work done. This
I have discovered to be true by making a magnet
to exert its force in front of a thermo-pile, which
uniformly exhibits a cooled face under such conditions.
What the particular form of the motion may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
be that we call magnetism, is not yet made out;
but that it is some form of motion, is very evident.
The following experiments may throw some light
upon it. Last August Mr. Kerr read a paper
before the British Association of Science, in
which was detailed the following experiment:
The pole of an electro-magnet was nicely polished
so as to reflect light like a mirror. A
beam of sunlight was permitted to fall upon it,
and be reflected to a convenient place for examination.
A current of electricity was sent
through the coil, which of course rendered the
iron magnetic; and it was noticed that the light
that was reflected from the pole was circularly
polarized: that is, the motion of a ray, instead of
being a simple undulatory movement, was now
made to assume such a motion as the water from
a garden-hose has when the nozzle is swung
round in a circle while the water is escaping
from it. After reading the account of it, it
occurred to me that the converse experiment
might be tried; that is to say, the effect of a circularly
polarized beam of light upon a piece of
steel. By concentrating a large beam of ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
plane polarized light with a quartz lens, and
passing it through a quarter wave-plate at the
proper angle, a powerful beam of circularly polarized
light was obtained. At the focus of this
beam a fine cambric needle without magnetism
was placed so that the light passed it longitudinally.
Ten minutes' exposure was sufficient to
make it decidedly magnetic. Hence I infer
that the motions which we call magnetic attractions
and repulsions may be quite analogous to
such helical motions; also, that these motions
exist in ether, and evidently may be either
right-handed or left-handed. Wind up on a pencil
a piece of wire twelve or fifteen inches long,
making a loose spiral. Bring the two ends of
the spiral together; and note first that one is
twisted to the right, the other to the left. If they
be twisted into each other, they will advance very
easily; but if a right-handed spiral were to be
interlocked with another like it, and both turned
in the direction of their spiral, they would separate
rapidly. Applying this conception to a magnet,
we might suppose that such spiral motions
will be set up in the ether by the magnet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that such motions re-acting upon ordinary matter
affect it as attraction and repulsion; and thus
we should have at least a conceivable mechanical
explanation of the phenomenon.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 375px;"><a name="Fig_5" id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/i-005.png" width="375" height="197" alt="FIG. 5." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 5.</span>
</div>

<p>There are numberless experiments which might
be given to further exhibit the relation of mass
motion to magnetism, but a single one more must
suffice. No rotation of a magnet upon its own
axis can produce any effects upon a current
that is exterior to it; but if a loop of wire be
kept stationary adjacent to a magnet, as in Fig. <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>, while the magnet revolves, a current of electricity
is produced; and if the magnet be kept
stationary, and the loop revolves, a current will
also be produced, but in the opposite direction.
Here, as in all the other cases, no electricity is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
originated, save when motion is imparted to one
or other of the parts. This experiment is due to
Faraday.</p>

<p>From all these cases we can come to but one
conclusion, that both electricity and magnetism
are but forms of motion; electricity being a form
of motion in ordinary matter, for it cannot be
made to pass through a vacuum, while magnetism
must be a form of motion induced in the
ether, for it is as effective in a vacuum as out of
it; electricity always needing some material conductor,
magnetism needing no more than do radiant
heat and light.</p>


<h3>VELOCITY.</h3>

<p>Measurements have been made of the velocity
of electricity; both that of high tension, such as
the spark from a Leyden jar, and also that from
a battery. The former was found to have a
velocity over 200,000 miles a second, while the
electricity from a battery may move as slowly as
15,000 or 20,000 miles a second; but this is very
largely a matter of conductors. Its velocity is
seldom above 30,000 miles a second on ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
telegraphic lines. If the electricity be used to
give signals, as in ordinary telegraphy, the time
required varies nearly as the length of the line,
and in any case is a much greater quantity.
Prescott in his work on the telegraph states that
"the time required to produce a signal on the
electro-magnet at the extremity of a line of 300
miles of No. 8 iron wire is about .01 seconds,
and that this time increases in a greater proportion
than the length of the line; for example, on
a line 600 miles in length it amounts to about .03
seconds." He also states that it varies much
with the kind of magnet used, some forms of
magnets being much more sensitive than others
for this work.</p>

<p>Wheatstone proved a good many years ago
that the duration of the electric spark was less
than one millionth of a second. When a swiftly
moving body can only be seen by an electric
spark, or flash of lightning, it looks as if it were
quiescent. Thus a train of cars rushing along
at the rate of forty or fifty miles per hour appears
sharply defined,&mdash;even the driving-wheels of the
locomotive can be seen in detail, which is impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in continuous light,&mdash;and all seems to be
standing still. In like manner will the sails of a
windmill, which may be turning at a rapid rate,
be seen apparently at rest. This is because in
the short time during which they are illuminated
they do not appreciably move.</p>

<p>I am not aware that any attempt has been
made to measure the velocity of magnetism. If,
however, it be a form of motion in ether, it is
probable that the velocity is comparable to the
velocity of radiant energy, light, which is equal to
about 186,000 miles a second.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<h2>SOUND.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> explaining the relation that sound has
to telephony, it will be necessary to make quite
plain what sound is, and how it affects the substance
of the body through which it moves. If
I strike my pencil upon the table, I hear a snap
that appears to the ear to be simultaneous with
the stroke: if, however, I see a man upon a
somewhat distant hill strike a tree with an axe, the
sound does not reach me until some appreciable
time has passed; and it is noted, that, the farther
away the place where a so-called sound originates,
the longer time does it take to reach any
listener. Hence sound has in air a certain
velocity which has been very accurately measured,
and found to be 1,093 feet per second when
the temperature of the air is at the freezing point
of water. As the temperature increases, the velocity
of sound will increase a little more than
one foot for every Fahrenheit degree; so that at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
60&deg; the velocity is 1,125 feet per second. This
is the velocity in air. In water the velocity is
about four times greater, in steel sixteen times,
in pine-wood about ten times.</p>


<h3>CONSTITUTION OF A SINGLE SOUND-WAVE.</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 187px;"><a name="Fig_6" id="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/i-006.png" width="187" height="375" alt="FIG. 6." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 6.</span>
</div>
<p>If a person stands at the distance of fifteen or
twenty rods from a cannon that is fired, he will
first see the flash, then the cloud of smoke that
rushes from the cannon's mouth, then the ground
will be felt to tremble, and lastly the sound will
reach his ear at the same time that a strong puff
of air will be felt. This puff of air is the sound-wave
itself, travelling at the rate of eleven hundred
feet or more per second. At the instant of
explosion of the gunpowder, the air in front of
the cannon is very much compressed; and this
compression at once begins to move outwards in
every direction, so as to be a kind of a spherical
shell of air constantly increasing in diameter;
and, whenever it reaches an ear, the sound is
perceived. Whenever such a sound-wave strikes
upon a solid surface, as upon a cliff or a building,
it is turned back, and the reflected wave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
may be heard; in which case we call it an echo.
When a cannon is fired, we generally hear the
sound repeated, so that it apparently lasts for a
second or more; but when, as in the first case,
we hear the sound of a pencil struck upon the
table, but a single short report
is noticed, and this, as may be
supposed, consists of a single
wave of condensed air.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig_7" id="Fig_7"></a>

<span class="caption">FIG. 7.</span>
</div>

<p>Imagine a tuning-fork that
is made to vibrate. Each of
the prongs beats the air in
opposite directions at the same
time. Look at the physical
condition of the air in front of
one of these prongs. As the
latter strikes outwards, the air
in front of it will be driven outwards, condensed;
and, on account of the elasticity of the air, the
condensation will at once start to travel outwards
in every direction,&mdash;a wave of denser air; but
directly the prong recedes, beating the air back
in the contrary direction, which will obviously
rarefy the air on the first side. But the disturbance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
we call rarefaction moves in air with the
same velocity as a condensation. We must
therefore remember, that just behind the wave of
condensation is the wave of rarefaction, both
travelling with the same velocity, and therefore
always maintaining the same relative position to
each other. Now, the fork vibrates a great many
times in a second, and will consequently generate
as many of these waves, all of them constituted
alike, and having the same length; by length
meaning the sum of the thicknesses of the condensation
and the rarefaction. Suppose a fork to
make one hundred vibrations per second: at the
end of the second, the wave generated by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
vibration at the beginning of the second would
have travelled, say, eleven hundred feet; and
evenly distributed between the fork and the outer
limit, would be ranged the intermediate waves
occupying the whole distance: that is to say, in
eleven hundred feet there would be one hundred
sound-waves, each of them evidently being eleven
feet long. If the fork made eleven hundred
vibrations per second, each of these waves would
be one foot long; for sound-waves of all lengths
travel in air with the same rapidity. Some late
experiments seem to show that the actual amplitude
of motion of the air, when moved by such a
high sound as that from a small whistle, is less
than the millionth of an inch.</p>


<h3>PITCH.</h3>

<p>The pitch of a sound depends wholly upon the
number of vibrations per second that produce
it; and if one of two sounds consists of twice as
many vibrations per second as the other one, they
differ in pitch by the interval called in music an
octave, this latter term merely signifying the
number of intervals into which the larger interval<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is divided for the ordinary musical scale. The
difference between a high and a low sound is
simply in the number of vibrations of the air
reaching the ear in a given time. The smaller
intervals into which the octave is divided stand
in mathematical relations to each other when
they are properly produced, and are represented
by the following fractions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-008.png" width="500" height="165" alt="Musical scale" title="" />
</div>

<p>These numbers are to be interpreted thus:
Suppose that we have a tuning-fork giving 256
vibrations per second: the sound will be that of
the standard or concert pitch for the C on the
added line as shown on the staff. Now, D when
properly tuned will make 9 vibrations while C
makes but 8; but, as C in this case makes 256,
D must make 256&times;<small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>8</sub></small>=288. In like manner G
is produced by 256&times;<small><sup>3</sup>/<sub>2</sub></small>=384, and C above by
256&times;2=512, and so on for any of the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
If other sounds are used in the octave above or
below this one, the number of vibrations of any
given note may be found by either doubling or
halving the number for the corresponding note in
the given octave. Thus G below will consist of
<small><sup>384</sup>/<sub>2</sub></small>=192, and G above of 384&times;2=768.</p>

<p>During the past century there has been a quite
steady rise in the standard pitch, and this has
been brought about in a very curious and unsuspected
way. The tuning-fork has been the
instrument to preserve the pitch, as it is the best
available instrument for such a purpose, it being
convenient to use, and does not vary as most other
musical instruments do. But a tuning-fork is
brought to its pitch with a file, which warms it
somewhat, so that at the moment when it is in
tune with the standard that is being duplicated
it is above its normal temperature; and when it
cools its tone rises. When another is made of
like pitch with this one, the same thing is repeated;
and so it has continued until the standard
pitch has risen nearly a tone higher than it was in
H&auml;ndel's time.</p>

<p>The common A and C tuning-forks to be had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in music stores, often vary a great deal from the
accepted concert pitch. Such as the writer has
measured have been generally too high; sometimes
being ten or more vibrations per second
beyond the proper number. The tuning-forks
made by M. K&ouml;enig of Paris are accurate within
the tenth of one vibration, the C making 256
vibrations in one second.</p>


<h3>LIMITS OF AUDIBILITY.</h3>

<p>Numerous experiments have been made to
determine the limits of audible sounds; and here
it is found that there is a very great difference in
individuals in their ability to perceive sounds.
Helmholtz states that about 23 vibrations per
second is the fewest in number that can be heard
as continuous sound; if they are fewer in number
than that, the vibrations are heard as separate
distinct noises, as when one knocks upon a door
four or five times a second. If one could knock
evenly 23 times per second, he would be making
a continuous musical sound of a very low pitch.
But this limit of 23 is not the limit for all:
some can hear a continuous sound with as few
as 16 or 18 vibrations per second, while others<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
are as far above the medium as this is below it.
The limits of sound in musical instruments are
about all included in the range of a 7-octave
pianoforte from F to F, say from 42 to 5,460
vibrations per second. But this high number is
not anywhere near the upper limit of audible
sounds for man.</p>

<p>Very many of the familiar sounds of insects,
such as crickets and mosquitoes, have a much
higher pitch. Helmholtz puts this upper limit
at 38,000 vibrations per second, and Despraetz at
36,850. The discrepancy of results is due solely
to the marked difference in individuals as to
acoustic perception.</p>

<p>For the production of high musical tones,
K&ouml;enig of Paris makes a set of steel rods. A
steel rod of a certain length, diameter, and
temper, will give a musical sound which may be
determined. The proper length for other rods
for giving higher tones may be determined by the
rule that the number of vibrations is inversely
proportional to the square of the length of the
rod.</p>

<p>The dimensions of these rods when made
2 c. m. in diameter are as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Dimensions of rods">
<tr><td align='center'>Length.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align='center'>Vibrations.</td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>47.5 &nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td><td align='left'>&nbsp;&nbsp;40,000</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>These rods need to be suspended upon loops
of silk, and they are struck with a piece of steel
so short as to be wholly beyond the ability of
any ear to hear its ring. Nothing but a short
thud is to be heard from it when it strikes, while
from the others comes a distinct ringing sound.
In experimenting with such a set of steel rods I
have not found any one yet who could hear as many
as 25,000 per second, my own limit being about
21,000. But it has been experimentally found
that children and youth have a perceptive power
for high sounds considerably above adults. Dr.
Clarence Blake of Boston reports a case in his
aural practice, of a woman whose hearing had
been gradually diminishing for some years until
she could not hear at all with one ear, and the
ticking of a watch could only be heard with the
other when the watch was held against the ear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
After treatment it was discovered that the sensibility
to high sounds was very great, and that
she could hear the steel rod having a tone of
40,000 vibrations.</p>

<p>Last year Mr. F. Galton, F.R.S., exhibited
before the Science Conference an instrument in
the shape of a very small whistle, which he had
devised for producing a very high sound. The
whistle had a diameter less than the one twenty-fifth
of an inch. The length could be varied by
moving a plug at the end of the whistle. It was
easy to make a sound upon such an instrument
that was altogether out of hearing-range of any
person. Mr. Galton tried some very interesting
experiments upon animals, by using these whistles.
He went through the Zo&ouml;logical Gardens,
and produced such high sounds near the ears
of all the animals. Some of them would prick
up their ears, showing that they heard the sound;
while others apparently could not hear it. He
declares that among all the animals the cat was
found to hear the sharpest sound. Small dogs
can also hear very shrill notes, while larger ones
can not. Cattle were found to hear higher sounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
than horses. The squeak of bats and of mice
cannot be heard by many persons who can hear
ordinary sounds as well as any; sharpness of
hearing having nothing to do with the limits of
hearing.</p>


<h3>EFFECTS OF SOUND UPON OTHER BODIES.</h3>

<p>If a vibrating tuning-fork be held close to a
delicately suspended body, the latter will approach
the fork, as if impelled by some attractive
force. The experiment can be made by fastening
a bit of paper about an inch square to a
straw five or six inches long, and then suspending
the straw to a thread, so that it is balanced
horizontally. Bring the vibrating tuning-fork
within a quarter of an inch of the paper. In this
case the motion of approach is due to the fact
that the pressure of the air is less close to a vibrating
body than at a distance from it; there is
therefore a slightly greater pressure on the side
of the paper away from the fork than on the side
next to it.</p>

<p>If a vibrating tuning-fork be held near to
the ear, and turned around, there may be found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
four places in one rotation where the sound will
be heard but very faintly, while in every other
position it can be heard plainly enough. The
extinction of the sound is due to what is called
interference. Each of the prongs of the fork is
giving out a sound-wave at the same time, but in
opposite directions, each wave advancing outwards
in every direction. Where the rarefied
part of one wave exactly balances the condensed
part of the other, there of course the sound will
be extinguished; and these lines of interference
are found to be hyperbolas, or, if considered with
reference to both entire waves, two hyperbolic
surfaces.</p>


<h3>SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS.</h3>

<p>When it is once understood that a musical
sound is caused by the vibrations more or less
frequent which only make the difference we call
pitch, it might at once be inferred, that if we
have a body that is capable of vibrating say a
hundred times a second, and it receives a hundred
pulses or pushes a second, it would in this
way be made to vibrate. Suppose, then, that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
take two tuning-forks, each capable of vibrating
256 times a second: if one be struck while the
other is left free, the former one will be giving to
the air 256 impulses per second, which will reach
the other fork, each pulse tending to move it a
little, the cumulative result being to make it
move perceptibly, that is, to give out a sound.
The principle is just the same as that employed
in the common swing. One push makes the
swing to move a little, upon its return another is
given, in like manner a third, and so on until a
person may be swung many feet high. If a glass
tumbler be struck, it gives out a musical sound
of a certain pitch, which will set a piano-string
sounding that is tuned to the same pitch, provided
that the damper be raised. It is said that
some persons' voices have broken tumblers by
singing powerfully near them the same note
which the tumblers could give out, the vibrations
of the tumblers being so great as to overcome
cohesion of the molecules.</p>

<p>There are very many interesting effects due to
sympathetic vibrations.</p>

<p>Large trees are sometimes uprooted by wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that comes in gusts timed to the rate of vibration
of the tree. When troops of soldiers are to
cross a bridge, the music ceases, and the ranks
are broken, lest the accumulated strain of timed
vibrations should break the structure; indeed,
such accidents have several times occurred.
There is not so much danger to a bridge when it
is heavily loaded with men or with cattle, as
when a few men go marching over it. "When
the iron bridge at Colebrooke Dale was building,
a fiddler came along, and said to the workmen
that he could fiddle their bridge down. The
builders thought this boast a fiddle-de-dee, and
invited the musician to fiddle away to his heart's
content. One note after another was struck
upon the strings, until one was found with which
the bridge was in sympathy. When the bridge
began to shake violently, the workmen were
alarmed at the unexpected result, and ordered
the fiddler to stop."</p>

<p>Some halls and churches are wretchedly adapted
to hear either speaking or singing in. If
wires be stretched across such halls, between the
speaker's stand and the opposite end, they will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
absorb the passing sound-waves, and will be made
to sympathetically vibrate, thus preventing in a
good degree the interfering echoes. The wire
should be rather fine piano-wire, and it should be
stretched so tightly as to give out a low musical
sound when plucked with the fingers. In a large
hall there should be twenty or more such wires.</p>


<h3>RESONANCE.</h3>

<p>When a tuning-fork is struck, and held out in
the air, the vibrations can be felt for a time by
the fingers; but the sound is hardly audible unless
the fork be placed close to the ear. Let the
stem of the fork rest upon the table, a chair, or
any solid body of considerable size, and the
sound is so much increased in loudness as to be
heard in every part of a large room. The reason
appears to be, that in the first case the vibrations
are so slight that the air is not much affected.
Most of the force of the vibration is absorbed by
the hand that holds it; but when the stem rests
upon a hard body of considerable extent, the
vibrations are given up to it, and every part of its
surface is giving off the vibrations to the air. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
other words, it is a much larger body that is now
vibrating, and consequently the air is receiving
the amplified sound-waves.</p>

<p>If the stem of the fork had been made to rest
upon a bit of rubber, the sound would not only
not have been re-enforced in such a way, but the
fork would very soon have been brought to rest;
for India rubber <i>absorbs</i> sound vibrations, and
converts them into heat vibrations, as is proved
by placing such a combination upon the face of
a thermo-pile.</p>

<p>If one will but put his hand upon a table or a
chair-back in any room where a piano or an organ
is being played, or where voices are singing,
especially in church, he cannot fail to feel the
sound; and if he notices carefully he will perceive
that some sounds make such table or seat
to shake much more vigorously than others,&mdash;a
genuine case of sympathetic vibrations.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that special materials and
shapes are given to parts of musical instruments,
so that they may respond to the various vibrations
of the strings or reeds. For instance, the
piano has an extensive thin board of spruce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
underneath all the strings, which is called the
sounding-board. This board takes up the vibrations
of the strings; but, unlike the rubber, gives
them all out to the air, greatly re-enforcing their
strength, and changing somewhat their quality.
But the air itself may act in like manner. In
almost any room or hall not more than fifteen or
twenty feet long, a person can find some tone of
the voice that will seem to meet some response
from the room. Some short tunnels will from
certain positions yield very powerful, responsive,
resonant tones. There is certainly one such in
Central Park, New York. It is forty or fifty feet
long. To a person standing in the middle of this,
and speaking or making any kind of a noise on
a certain pitch, the resonance is almost deafening.
It is easy to understand. When a column
of air enclosed in a tube is made to vibrate by
any sound whose wave-length is twice the length
of the tube, we have such column of air now
filled with the condensed part of the wave, and
now with the rarefied part; and as these motions
cannot be conducted laterally, but must move in
the direction of the length of the tube, the air has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
a very great amplitude of motion, and the sound
is very loud. If one end of the tube be closed,
then the length must be but one-fourth of the
wave-length of the sound. Take a tuning-fork of
any convenient pitch, say a C of 512 vibrations
per second: hold it while vibrating over a vertical
test-tube about eight inches long. No response
will be heard; but, if a little water be carefully
poured into the tube to the depth of about two
inches, the tube will respond loudly, so that it
might be heard over a large hall. In this case
the length of the air-column that was responding,
being one-fourth the wave-length, would give
twenty-four inches as the wave-length of that
fork.</p>

<p>It is easy in this way to measure approximately
the number of vibrations made by a fork.</p>

<p>When a vibrating tuning-fork is placed opposite
the embouchure of an organ-pipe of the same
pitch, the pipe will resound to it, giving quite a
volume of sound. In 1872 it occurred to me,
that the action of an organ-pipe might be quite
like that of a vibrating reed in front of the embouchure.
As the air is driven past it from the
bellows, the form of the escaping air will evidently
be like a thin, elastic strip; and, having considerable
velocity, it will carry off by friction a little
of the air in the tube: this will of course rarefy
the air in the tube somewhat, and a wave of condensation
will travel down the tube. At the bottom,
being suddenly stopped, its re-action will be
partly outwards, and so will drive the strip of air
away from the tube. After this will follow, for a
like reason, the other phase of the wave, the rarefaction,
which will swing the strip of air towards
the tube. This theory I verified by filling the
bellows with smoke, and watching the motion of
the escaping air and smoke with a stroboscope.
This view is now advocated by an organ-builder
in England, Herman Smith; but whether he discovered
it before or after me, I do not know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>When a membrane vibrates, its motion is generally
perceptible to the eye; and it may have a
very great amplitude of motion, as in the case of
the drum; and various instruments have been
devised for the study of vibrations, using membranes
like rubber, gold-beater's skin, or even
tissue paper, to receive the vibrations. One of
the musical instruments of a former generation
of boys was the comb. A strip of paper was
placed in front of it, and placed at the mouth,
and sung through, the paper responding to the
pitch with a loose nasal sound. K&ouml;enig fixed a
membrane across a small capsule, one side of
which was connected by a tube to any source of
sound, and the other side to a gas-pipe and a
small burner. A sound made in the tube would
shake the flame, and a mirror moving in front of
the flame would show a zigzag outline corresponding
to the sound vibrations.</p>

<p>In like manner if a thin rubber be stretched
over the end of a tube one or two inches in diameter
and four or five inches long, and a bit of
looking-glass one-fourth of an inch square be
made fast to the middle of the membrane, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
motions of the latter can be seen by letting a
beam of sunlight fall upon the mirror so as to be
reflected upon a white wall or screen a few feet
away. (Fig. <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>.)</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 8.</span>

<p>When a sound is made in this tube, the spot of
light will at once assume some peculiar form,&mdash;either
a straight line with some knots of light in
it, or some curve simple or compound, and such
as are known as Lissajous curves. If, while some
of these forms are upon the screen, the instrument
be moved sideways, the forms will change
to undulating lines with or without loops, varying
with the pitch and intensity, but being alike for
the same pitch and intensity. (Fig. <a href="#Fig_9">9</a>)</p>

<p>This instrument I called the opeidoscope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The vibration of a membrane and that of a
solid differ chiefly in the amplitude of such vibration.
The scratch of a pin at one end of a long
log can be heard by an ear applied to the other
end of the log; but every molecule in the log
must move slightly; and there are all degrees of
movement between that visible to the eye, which
we call mass motion,
and that
called molecular
simply because
we cannot measure
the amplitude
of the motion.
We may,
then, roughly divide
all bodies into two classes, as to their relations
to sound,&mdash;such as re-enforce it, and such
as distribute it: the first depending upon the form
of the body, as related to a particular sound; the
second independent of form, and responding to
all orders of vibrations. Air, wood, and metals
belong in this latter class. The common toy-string
telegraph, or <i>lovers' telegraph</i>, is an example<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of this class. Two tin boxes are connected by a
string passing through the middle of the bottom
of each. When the string is stretched, and a
person speaks in one box, what is said can be
heard by an ear applied at the other. If the
speaking-tubes be made about four inches in
diameter, and about four inches deep, they are
capable of doing much more service than is generally
supposed to be possible. I know of two
lines, one of five hundred feet and the other
of a thousand feet in length, over which one can
talk, and be heard with distinctness. In the line
of a thousand feet, the end of the tube is made
of sheepskin tightly stretched, and the line is
made of No. 8 cotton thread. The greater the
tension, the better is the sound transmitted. The
thread is supported at intervals by running through
a loop on the ends of cords not less than three
feet long, attached to supports. The thread
pierces the membrane, and is attached to a
small button which is in contact with the membrane.
Wind and rain affect this line disadvantageously.
The other line of five hundred feet,
between a passenger and a freight depot, has the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
tube end covered with stretched calfskin. Instead
of thread, a copper-relay wire is employed
(any small uninsulated wire will do as well).
This permits a good tension, and is unaffected
by the weather. One may stand in front of it
about three feet, and converse with ease, and in
an ordinary tone. The wire is supported in
loops of string, as in the other.</p>

<p>Musicians have in all times employed various
instruments for the production of musical effects.
Whistles made of bone were used by pre-historic
men, some of them having finger-holes so that
different tones could be produced. A stag-horn
that was blown like a flageolet, and having three
finger-holes, has also been found; while on the
old monuments of Egypt are pictured harps,
pipes with seven finger-holes, a kind of flute,
drums, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. In
later times these primeval forms have been modified
into the various instruments in use in the
modern orchestra. It seems as if no musician
had ever been interested in the question as to
why one instrument should give out a sound so
different from another one, even though it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sounding upon the same pitch. No one can ever
mistake the sound of a violin, or a horn, or a
piano, for any other instrument; and no two
persons have voices alike. This difference in
tone, which enables us to identify an instrument
by its sound or a friend by his voice, is called
quality of tone, or <i>timbre</i>.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, that great German
physicist Helmholtz undertook the investigation
of this subject, and succeeded in unravelling the
whole mystery of the qualities of sound.</p>

<p>He discovered first, that a musical sound is
very rarely a simple tone, but is made up of
several tones, sometimes as many as ten or fifteen,
having different degrees of intensity and pitch.
The lowest sound, which is also the strongest, is
called the <i>fundamental;</i> and it is this tone we
mean when we speak of the pitch of a sound, as
the pitch of middle C upon a piano, or the pitch
of the <i>A</i> string on a violin. The higher sounds
that accompany the fundamental are called sometimes
harmonics, sometimes upper partial tones,
but generally <i>overtones</i>. The character or quality
of a sound depends altogether upon the number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and intensity of these overtones associated with
the fundamental. If a sound can be made upon a
pipe and a violin, that consists wholly of the fundamental
with no overtones, the two instruments
sound absolutely alike. It is exceedingly difficult
to do this; and such sound when produced is
smooth, but without character, and unpleasing.</p>

<p>Second, Helmholtz discovered that the overtones
always stand in the simplest mathematical
relation to the fundamental tone,&mdash;in fact, are
simple multiples of that tone, being two, three,
four, and so on, times the number of vibrations
of it.</p>

<p>This will be readily understood by considering
the position of such related sounds when they
are written upon the staff.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-011.png" width="500" height="192" alt="Musical scale" title="" />
</div>

<p>If we start with C in the bass as indicated in
the staff, calling that the fundamental, then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
notes that will represent the above ratios are
those indicated by smaller notes, which are the
overtones up to the ninth. The first overtone,
being produced by twice the number of vibrations,
must be the octave; the second, the fifth of the
second octave; the third will be two octaves
from the first, and so on: the number of vibrations
of each of these notes being the number
of the fundamental multiplied by its order in the
series.</p>

<p>Taking C with 128 vibrations, we have for this
series:&mdash;</p>

<p>This series is continued up to the limits of
hearing. Now, it appears that all instruments do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
not give the complete series: indeed, it is not
possible to obtain them all upon some instruments.
Each of them, however, when present
helps in the general effect which we call quality.
Sometimes the overtones are more prominent
than the fundamental, as when a piano-wire is
struck with a nail. It has always been noticed
that it does not give out the sound that is wanted
when it is struck in this way. Hence it is the
art of an instrument-maker to so construct the
instrument as to develop and re-enforce such
tones as are pleasing, and to suppress the interfering
and disagreeable overtones. Piano-makers
learned by trial where was the proper place to
strike the stretched wire in order to develop
the most musical sound upon it; but no reason
could be given until it was observed that striking
it at a point about one-seventh or one-ninth its
length from either end prevented the development
of the objectionable overtones, the seventh and
the ninth. Hence they can scarcely be heard in
a properly constructed instrument. These overtones
are very discordant with the lower sounds.</p>

<p>Organ-pipes have their specific qualities given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to them by making them wide-mouthed, narrow-mouthed,
conical, and so on; shapes which experience
has determined give pleasing sounds with
different qualities.</p>

<p>The violin is an instrument that seems to
puzzle makers more than almost any other.
Some of the old violins made two hundred years
ago by the Amati family at Cremona are worth
many times their weight in gold. Recent makers
have tried in vain to equal them; but, when their
ingenuity and skill have failed, they declare that
<i>age</i> has much to do with such instruments, that
age mellows the sounding quality of the violin.
But the Cremona violins were just as extraordinary
instruments when they left the hands of
the makers as they are now; and the fame of the
Amati family as violin-makers was over all Europe
while they were living.</p>

<p>A good violin when well played gives an exquisite
musical effect, and on account of its range
and quality of tones it is the leading orchestral
instrument, always pleasing and satisfying; but in
unskilled hands even the best <i>Cremona</i> will give
forth sounds that make one grieve that it was ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
invented. Overtones of all sorts and with all
degrees of prominence may be easily developed
upon it: therefore the skilful player draws the
bow at such a place upon the strings as to
develop the overtones he wants, and suppress the
ones not wanted. The usual rule is to draw the
bow about an inch below the bridge; but the
place for the bow depends upon where the fingers
are that stop the strings, and also the pressure
upon it. It requires an almost incredible amount
of practice to be able to play a violin very well.</p>

<p>In the accompanying table will be found the
component parts of tones upon a few instruments
in common use.</p>


<h3>TONE COMPOSITION.</h3>

<p>The components of the tones are indicated by
lines in the column underneath the figures representing
the series. Thus the narrow-stopped
organ-pipe gives a sound composed of a fundamental,
and overtones three, five, seven, and nine
times the number of vibrations of it.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred that all of the overtones
are of equal strength: they are very far from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that; but these differ in different instruments,
and it is this that constitutes the difference
between a good instrument and a poor one of the
same name.</p>

<p>In a few of the spaces very light lines are
made for the purpose of indicating that such
overtones are quite weak. For instance: the
piano has the sixth, seventh, and eighth thus
marked; these tones being suppressed by the
mechanism, as described on a former page.</p>

<p>Only a few of the many forms of organ-pipes
are given; but these are sufficient to show what
a physical difference there is between the musical
tones in such pipes.</p>

<p>As for the human voice, it is very rich in overtones;
but no two voices are alike, therefore it
would be impossible to tabulate the components
of it in the manner they are tabulated for musical
instruments.</p>

<p>In Helmholtz's experiments in the analysis of
sounds, use was made of the principle of resonance
of a body of air enclosed in a vessel. In the
experiment with the tuning-fork to determine the
wave-length, p. <a href="#Page_78">78</a>, it is remarked that no response<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
came until the volume of the air in the tube was
reduced to a certain length, which depended upon
the vibration number of the fork. If instead of
a test-tube a bottle had been taken, the result
would have been the same. Every kind of a
vessel can respond to some tone of a definite
wave-length, and a sphere has been found to give
the best results. These are made with a hole on
one side for the sound-wave to enter, and a projection
on the opposite side, through which a hole
about the one-eighth of an inch is made, this to
be placed in the ear. Any sound that is made
in front of the large orifice will not meet any
response, unless it be that particular one which
the globe can naturally re-enforce, when it will
be plainly heard. Suppose, then, one has a
series of twenty or more of these, graduated to
the proper size for re-enforcing sounds in the
ratio of one, two, three, four, and so on. Take
any instrument, say a flute: have one to blow it
upon the proper pitch to respond to the largest
sphere, then take each of the spheres in their
order, applying them to the ear while the flute is
being sounded. When the overtones are present<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they will be heard plainly and distinct from the
fundamental sound. In like manner any or all
other sounds may be studied.</p>

<p>But Helmholtz did not stop after analyzing
sounds of so many kinds: he invented a method
of synthesis, by which the sounds of any kind of
an instrument could be imitated. A tuning-fork,
when made to vibrate by an electric current, gives
out a tone without harmonics or overtones. So
if a series of forks with vibration periods equal
to the numbers of the series of overtones given
on p. <a href="#Page_86">86</a> be so arranged that any of them may
be made to vibrate at will, it is evident that the
resulting compound tone would be comparable
with that from an instrument having such overtones.
Thus, if with a tuning-fork giving a fundamental
C, other forks giving two, three, and
four times the number of the fundamental were
associated, each one giving a simple tone, we
should have for a resultant the tone of a flute,
as shown on p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>. If one, three, five, seven,
and nine, were all sounded, the resulting tone
would be that of the clarionet, and so on. This
he actually accomplished, and now makers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
physical apparatus advertise just such instruments.</p>

<p>Helmholtz also contrived a set of tuning-forks,
which, when bowed, will give out the vowel
sounds like the voice.</p>

<p>It was remarked upon p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a> that it has generally
been considered that age has a mellowing
effect upon the sound of a violin. Once in
possession of the facts concerning sound that
have been alluded to on the preceding pages,
it is easy to see how such an opinion should arise,
and also the fallacy of it. It is proved conclusively
that the ability to hear high sounds decreases
as one grows older. As the violin gives
a very great number of overtones, even up to the
limits of audibility, it is plain that if such an
instrument should not change in its quality of
tone in the least degree, yet to a man who played
upon it for a number of years it would seem to
change by subtracting some of the higher overtones
from the sound; that is, it would seem to
become mellower. There is no evidence that
such a physical change takes place in the instrument.
It is not here affirmed that no change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
does take place. It may be probable; but all
the evidence we have is the opinions of individuals
whose hearing we know does change; and this
change is competent to modify the judgment as
to the quality of the sound in the same direction.
Before it can be affirmed that such a physical
change does take place in the violin as to make
a perceptible difference in the quality of its tone,
it will be needful to determine accurately the
number and intensity of the overtones at intervals
during many years, and then to compare
them. This has not yet been done.</p>


<h3>FORM OF A COMPOUND SOUND-WAVE IN AIR.</h3>

<p>Upon p. <a href="#Page_63">63</a> is given a picture of the form of a
simple sound-wave in air, which, as described, consists
of two parts, a condensation and a rarefaction.
All simple sound-waves have such a form;
but when two or more sound-waves that stand in
some simple ratio to each other, as do the sounds
of musical instruments, are formed in air, the
resulting wave is more or less complex in structure;
and where there are many components, as
there are where a number of different kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
instruments are all sounding at once, it is well-nigh
impossible to figure even approximately the
form of such wave-combinations. It is generally
given in treatises upon sound with ordinates representing
the factors with their relative intensities.
When the extremities of the ordinates are
connected, there is drawn a curved line with regularly
recurring loops. This cannot give a correct
idea of the form of the wave, because the motion
of a particle of air is not up and down like a
floating body upon waving water, but it is forward
and back, in the direction of the motion of
the wave.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#Fig_10">10</a> three simple sound-waves are thus
represented at 1, 2, and 3, these having the wave-length
1, 2, and 3. In 4, the three are combined
into one compound wave, and better show the
form of a transverse section of such a sound-wave
in the air. The organ-pipe called the principal
gives out such a compound wave as is seen by
referring to the table on p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>. The second
overtone, however, is quite weak in that pipe,
which would so modify the form as to lessen
somewhat the density at <i>b</i>, and increase it at <i>a</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;"><a name="Fig_10" id="Fig_10"></a>
<img src="images/i-013.png" width="475" height="497" alt="FIG. 10." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 10.</span>
</div>

<p>In like manner the space in the length of
the fundamental sound, whatever it may be, is
divided up into a number of minor condensations
and rarefactions, which may strengthen
each other, or so interfere as to change the position
of both; as is seen in the figure at <i>b</i>, where
the condensation due to wave 2 interferes with
the rarefaction of 3.</p>

<h2>CORRELATION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> treated at some length of the three factors
involved in telephony,&mdash;namely, electricity,
magnetism, and sound,&mdash;it remains to follow up
the various steps that have led to the actual transmission
of musical sounds and speech over an
ordinary electric circuit.</p>

<p>It is stated upon p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>, that, when a current
of electricity is passed through a coil of wire
that surrounds a rod of soft iron, the latter is
made a temporary magnet: it loses its magnetic
property the instant that the current ceases.
If the rod be of considerable size, say a foot or
more in length, and half an inch or more in diameter,
and the current be strong enough to make
a powerful magnet of it, whenever the current
from the battery is broken, the bar may be heard
to give out a single <i>click</i>. This will happen as
often as the current is broken. This is occasioned
by a molecular movement which results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in a <i>change</i> of <i>length</i> of the bar. When it is
made a magnet, it elongates about 1/25000 of its
length; and, when it loses its magnetism, it <i>suddenly</i>
regains its original length; and this change
is accompanied with the sound. This sound was
first noticed by Prof. C. G. Page of Salem, Mass.,
in 1837. If some means be devised for breaking
such a circuit more than fifteen or sixteen times
a second, we shall have a continuous sound with a
pitch depending upon the number of clicks per
second. Such a device was first invented by the
same man, and was accomplished by fixing the
armature of an electro-magnet to a spring which
was in the circuit when the spring was pressing
against a metallic knob, at which time the current
made the circuit in the coil of the electro-magnet.
The magnet attracting the armature away from
the button broke the circuit, which of course
destroyed the magnetism of the magnet, and
allowed the spring to fly back against the button,
to complete the circuit and reproduce the same
series of changes. The rapidity with which the
current may be broken in this way is only limited
by the strength of both spring and current. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
greater the tension of the spring with a given
current, the greater number of vibrations will it
make.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="Fig_11" id="Fig_11"></a>
<img src="images/i-014.png" width="450" height="312" alt="FIG. 11." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 11.</span>
</div>

<p>Suppose such an intermittent current to pass
through the coil surrounding the soft iron rod,
256 times per second; then the rod would evidently
give 256 clicks per second, which would
have the pitch of C. When these clicks are
produced in the rod hold in the hand, the
sound is hardly perceptible, being like that of a
sounding tuning-fork when held thus. In order
to strengthen it, it is necessary to place it on
some resonant surface. It is customary to mount<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it upon an oblong box with one or two holes in
its upper surface, inasmuch as such a form is
found to give a louder response than any other,
and is the shape usually given to &AElig;olian harps.
The accompanying cut shows the combination of
battery B, the circuit-breaker, and the rod mounted
upon the box. The wire W may evidently
be of any length, the magnetized rod and box
responding to the number of vibrations of the
spring S, how long soever the circuit may be.</p>


<h3>HELMHOLTZ' ELECTRIC INTERRUPTOR.</h3>

<p>In some of Helmholtz' experiments, it was
essential to maintain the vibrations of a tuning-fork
for a considerable time. He effected this
by placing a short electro-magnet between the
prongs of the fork, and affixing a platinum point
at the end of one prong in such a manner, that,
as the prong descended in its vibration, the platinum
point dipped into a small cup of mercury
that completed the circuit. When the prong receded,
it was of course withdrawn from the mercury,
and the current was broken. As it is not
possible for a tuning-fork to vibrate in more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
one period, such an arrangement would evidently
make and break the current as many times per
second as the fork vibrated. When, therefore,
such an interruptor is inserted in the circuit with
the click-rod on its resonant box, the latter must
give out just such a sound as the fork is giving.
With such a device, it is possible to reproduce at
almost any distance in a telegraphic circuit, a
sound of a given pitch. It is therefore a true
telephone.</p>


<h3>REISS' TELEPHONE.</h3>

<p>The ease with which membranes are thrown
into vibrations corresponding in period to that
of the sounding body has already been alluded
to on p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>; and several attempts have been
made, at different times, to make membranes
available in telephony. The first of these attempts
was made by Philip Reiss of Friedrichsdorf,
Germany, in 1861.</p>

<p>His apparatus consisted of a hollow box, with
two apertures: one in front, in which was inserted
a short tube for producing the sound in,
and indicated by the arrow in the cut, Fig. <a href="#Fig_12">12</a>;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the other on the top. This was covered with the
membrane <i>m</i>,&mdash;a piece of bladder stretched
tight over it. Upon the middle of the membrane,
a thin piece of platinum was glued; and
this piece of platinum was connected by a wire
to a screw-cup from which another wire went to a
battery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;"><a name="Fig_12" id="Fig_12"></a>
<img src="images/i-015.png" width="425" height="323" alt="FIG. 12." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 12.</span>
</div>

<p>A platinum finger, S, rested upon the strip of
platinum, but was made fast at one end to the
screw-cup that connected with the other wire from
the battery. Now, when a sound is made in the
box, the membrane is made to vibrate powerfully:
this makes the platinum strip to strike as often
upon the platinum finger, and as often to bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
away from it, thus making and breaking the current
the same number of times per second. If,
then, a person sings into this box while it is in
circuit with the afore-mentioned click-rod and
box, the latter will evidently change its pitch as
often as it is changed by the voice. In this apparatus
we have a telephone with which a melody
may be reproduced at a distance with distinctness.
But the sounds are not loud, and they
have a tin-trumpet quality. If one reflects upon
the possibilities of such a mechanism, and upon
the conditions necessary to produce a sound of
any given quality, as that of the voice or of a
musical instrument as described in preceding
pages, he will understand that it can reproduce
only pitch. It might here be inferred that something
more than a single pitch is transmitted if
the sound is like that of a tin trumpet as stated:
but the reason of this is that, whenever a current
is passing between two surfaces that can move
only slightly on each other, there is always an
irregularity in the conduction, so as to produce
a kind of scratching sound; and it is this, combined
with the other, the true pitch, that gives the
character to the sound of this instrument.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Wright found that a sound of considerable
intensity could be obtained by passing the interrupted
current through the primary wire of a
small induction coil, and placing a conductor
made of two sheets of silvered paper placed
back to back in the secondary circuit. The silvered
paper becomes rapidly charged and discharged,
making a sound that can be heard over
a large hall, and having the same pitch as the
sending instrument.</p>


<h3>GRAY'S TELEPHONES.</h3>

<p>In 1873 Mr. Elisha Gray of Chicago discovered
that if an induction coil be made to operate
by the current from any automatic circuit-breaker,
and one of the wires from the secondary circuit be
held in the hand while the dry finger of the same
hand is rubbed upon a sonorous metallic plate,
the other wire being in connection with the
plate, a musical sound would be given <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'out by'">outby</ins> the
plate, appearing to come from the point of contact
of the finger with the plate. He therefore
contrived a musical instrument with a range of
two octaves, in which the reeds were made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
vibrate by electro magnets, the current entering
any one by depressing the appropriate key. This
circuit is sent through the primary wire of an
induction coil while one of the terminals of the
secondary coil is connected with the thin sheet
metal that forms one head of a shallow wooden
drum about eight inches in diameter, which is so
fixed as to be rotated like a pulley. The other
terminal is held in the hand while one finger of
the same hand rests upon the metallic surface.
While the drum is turned with the other hand,
the sounds given out have considerable intensity.
The faster the drum is turned, the louder do the
sounds become, though the pitch remains the
same.</p>

<p>In this case, as in the case mentioned on p. <a href="#Page_105">105</a>, we have an electric current passing between
two surfaces that are moving upon each other;
the contact not being uniform, the current is varying
as well as intermittent.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray has also invented a musical telephone
by means of which many musical sounds may
be simultaneously transmitted and reproduced.
The actual mechanism used is quite complex, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
requires considerable familiarity with electrical
science in order to understand it; but the fundamental
principle involved is not difficult to one
who has comprehended the preceding descriptions.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a series of four steel
reeds, each one fixed at one end to one pole of a
short electro-magnet, while the other end is left
free to vibrate over the other pole of the magnet
and not quite touching it. Each of the reeds is
to be tuned to a different pitch, say the 1, 3,
5, and 8 of the scale. These electro-magnets
with their attached vibrators are to be attached
each to a resonant box (see p. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>), which can
respond to that particular number of vibrations
per second. This is the receiving instrument.
The sender consists of a like set of reeds tuned
to the same pitch, which can be made to vibrate
at will by pressing a key which sends the current
of electricity through its electro-magnet, which
makes and breaks the current. Imagine one of
these keys to be pressed down so as to make the
circuit complete: the sending instrument then has
one of its reeds, let it be the 1 of the scale, set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in vibration; the intermittent current traverses the
whole line, going through all four of the receiving
instruments. Now, we know from the study of
the action of sounding bodies, that only one of
the four receivers is competent to vibrate in
consonance with this tone, and this one will
respond; that is, the vibrations are truly sympathetic
vibrations. If, instead of making the 1 of
the scale in the sending-instrument, the 3 had
been made, the current would have gone through
all of the receiving instruments just the same as
before, but only one of them could take up that
vibratory movement: three of them would remain
at rest, the 3 responding loudly. In like manner,
any number of vibrating reeds in the sending
instrument can make a corresponding number of
reeds in the receiving instrument to vibrate, provided
the latter be exactly tuned with the former.
Each transmitter is connected with but a part of
the battery, so that several tones may be transmitted
at the same time. If the performer plays
a piece of music in its various parts, every part
will be reproduced: thus we have a compound or
multiple telephone. This instrument has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
used during the past winter to give concerts in
cities when the performer was in a distant place.</p>

<p>It has also been used as a multiple telegraph;
as many as eight operators sending messages
simultaneously over the same wire,&mdash;four in each
direction,&mdash;without the slightest interference.</p>


<h3>BELL'S TELEPHONE.</h3>

<p>Prof. A. Graham Bell of Boston independently
discovered the same means for producing multiple
effects over the same wire; but it appears
he did not practically work it out as completely
as did Mr. Gray. But while the latter was chiefly
employed in perfecting the method as a telegraphic
system, Prof. Bell had set before himself
the more difficult problem of transmitting speech.
This he has actually accomplished, as we have so
often been reminded during the past year.</p>

<p>Thoroughly conversant with the acoustic researches
of Helmholtz, and keeping in mind the
complex form of the air vibrations produced by
the human voice, he attempted to make these
vibrations produce corresponding pulsations in
an electric current in the manner analogous to
the electric interrupter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Observing that membranes when properly
stretched can vibrate to any kind of a sound, he
sought to utilize them for this purpose. So did
Reiss; but Reiss inserted the vibrating membrane
into the circuit, and it was quite evident
that such a plan would not answer, therefore the
current must not be broken; but could an electric
current be interfered with without breaking
the connections?</p>

<p>The well-known re-actions of magnets upon
electrical currents, first noted by Oersted, and
fully developed by Faraday, gave the clew to the
solution. A piece of iron should be made to vibrate
by means of sound vibrations, so as to affect an electro-magnet
and induce corresponding electrical pulsations.</p>


<h3>FIRST FORM OF SPEAKING-TELEPHONE.</h3>

<p>A membrane of gold-beater's skin was tightly
stretched over the end of a speaking-tube or funnel;
on the middle of this membrane a piece of
iron, N S, Fig. <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>, was glued. In front of this
piece of iron an electro-magnet M is so situated
that its poles are opposite to it, but not quite touching
it. One of the terminal wires of the electro-magnet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
goes to the battery B; the other goes to the
receiving instrument R, which consists of a tubular
electro-magnet, the coil being enclosed in a short
tube of soft iron; the wire thence goes to the plate
E&acute;, which is sunk in the earth. On the top of R, at
P, is a rather loose, thin disk of iron, which acts as
an armature to the electro-magnet below it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig_13" id="Fig_13"></a>
<img src="images/i-016.png" width="500" height="467" alt="FIG. 13." title="" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 13.</span>
</div>

<p>Supposing that all the parts are thus properly
connected, the current of electricity from the battery
makes both M and R magnetic; the electro-magnet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
M will inductively make the piece of
iron N S, a magnet, with its poles unlike those of
the inducing electro-magnet; and the two will
mutually attract each other. If now this piece of
iron N S be made to move toward M, a current of
electricity will be induced in the coils, which will
traverse the whole circuit. This induced electricity
will consist of a single wave or pulse, and its force
will depend upon the velocity of the approach of N S
to M. A like pulse of electricity will be induced in
the coils when N S is made to move away from M;
but this current will move through the circuit in the
opposite direction, so that whether the pulsation
goes from M to R, or from R to M, depends simply
upon the direction of the motion of N S.</p>

<p>The electricity thus generated in the wire by such
vibratory movements varies in strength proportional
to the movement of the armature; therefore the
line wire between two places will be filled with electrical
pulsation exactly like the a&euml;rial pulsations in
structure. Fig. <a href="#Fig_10">10</a>, p. <a href="#Page_98">98</a>, may be used to illustrate
the condition of the wire through which the
currents pass. The dark part may represent the
strongest part of the wave, while the lighter part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
would show the weaker part of the wave. The chief
difference would be, that electricity travels so fast,
that what is there represented as one wave in air
with a length of two feet would, in an electric
wave, be more than fifty miles long.</p>

<p>These induced electric currents are but very
transient (see p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>); and their effect upon the
receiver R is to either increase or decrease the
power of the magnet there, as they are in one
direction or the other, and consequently to vary
the attractive power exercised upon the iron plate
armature.</p>

<p>Let a simple sound be now made in the tube,
consisting of 256 vibrations per second: the membrane
carrying the iron will vibrate as many
times, and so many pulses of induced electricity
will be <i>imposed</i> upon the constant current, which
will each act upon the receiver, and cause so
many vibrations of the armature upon it; and an
ear held at P will hear the sound with the same
pitch as that at the sending instrument. If two
or more sound-waves act simultaneously upon
the membrane, its motions must correspond with
such combined motions; that is, its motions will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be the resultant of all the sound-waves, and the
corresponding pulsations in the current must
reproduce at R the same effect. Now, when
a person speaks in the tube, the membrane is
thrown into vibrations more complex in structure
than those just mentioned, differing only in number
and intensity. The magnet will cause responses
from even the minutest motion; and
therefore an ear at R will hear what is said at
the tube. This was the instrument exhibited at
the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, and
concerning which Sir William Thompson said on
his return to England, "This is the greatest by
far of all the marvels of the electric telegraph."</p>

<p>The popular impression has been, concerning
the telephone, that the <i>sound</i> was in some way
conveyed over the wire. It will be obvious to
every one who may read this, that such is very
far from being the case. The fact is, it is a beautiful
example of the convertibility of forces from
one form to another. There is first the initial
vibratory mechanical motion of the air, which is
imparted to the membrane carrying the iron.
This motion is converted into electricity in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
coil of wire surrounding the electro-magnet, and
at the receiving-end is first effective as magnetism,
which is again converted into vibratory
motion of the iron armature, which motion is
imparted to the air, and so becomes again a
sound-wave in air like the original one.</p>

<p>This was the first speaking-telephone that was
ever constructed, so far as the writer is aware, but
it was not a practicable instrument. Many sounds
were not reproduced at all, and, according to the
report of the judges at the Philadelphia Exposition,
one needed to shout himself hoarse in order that
he might be heard at all.</p>


<h3>THE AUTHOR'S TELEPHONE.</h3>

<p>For several years past my regularly recurring
duties have taken me over the various subjects
treated of in this book, and each one has been extensively
illustrated in an experimental way, and a
considerable number of new pieces of apparatus
and new experiments to exhibit their phenomena
have been devised by me.</p>

<p>Among these, I would mention the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Measurement of the elongation of a magnetized bar.</p>

<p>2. A magneto-electric telegraph.</p>

<p>3. An electro-magnetic instrument for demonstrating
the rotation of the earth.</p>

<p>4. The permanent magnetism of the magnetic phantom.</p>

<p>5. The convertibility of sound into electricity.</p>

<p>6. The induction of a vibrating magnet upon an electric
circuit.</p>

<p>7. The origination of electric waves in a circuit by a
sounding magnet.</p>

<p>8. The discovery of the action of the air in a sounding
organ-pipe.</p>

<p>9. Two or three methods for studying the vibrations of
membranes.</p>

<p>10. Lissajous forks for enlarged projections of sound
vibrations.</p></div>

<p>As soon, therefore, as I gave attention to the subject
of telephony, I was able, with a few preliminary
experiments, to determine the proper conditions
for the transmission of speech in an electric circuit;
and, without the slightest knowledge of the
mechanism which Prof. Bell had used, I devised
the following arrangement for a speaking-telephone.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Fig_14" id="Fig_14"></a>

<span class="caption">FIG. 14.&mdash;END VIEW.</span>
</div>

<p>My first speaking-telephone, Fig. <a href="#Fig_14">14</a>, consisted
of a magnet made out of half-inch round steel
bent into a U form, having the poles about two
inches apart. Over these were slipped two
bobbins taken from an old telegraph register,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and were already fitted to a half-inch core.
These bobbins, two inches and a half long, were
wound with cotton-covered copper wire, No. 23,
each bobbin containing
about 150 feet.
This magnet, with the
bobbins slipped upon
its poles, was made fast
to a post two or three
inches high. The steel
was made as strongly
magnetic as was possible,
and would hold up three or four times its own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
weight. In front of the poles, a sheet of thin
steel, one-fiftieth of an inch thick, was made fast
to an upright board having a hole cut through it
three and a half inches in diameter (Fig. <a href="#Fig_14">14</a>, end
view); the plate was screwed tightly to this board,
so as to cover the hole; and the middle of the
hole was at the same height as the two poles of
the magnet. The wires from the two bobbins
were connected, as if to make an electro-magnet;
while the two free terminals were to be connected
with the line-wires. Of course there were two
of these instruments, both alike; and talking and
singing were reproduced with these.</p>

<p>A very great number of experiments have been
made to determine the best conditions for each of
the essential parts,&mdash;the size and strength of the
magnet, the size of the bobbins, as to length and
fineness of wire, the best thickness for the plate
for absorbing the vibrations, &amp;c.; and it is really
surprising, how little is the difference between
very wide limits. The following directions will
enable any one to construct a speaking-telephone
with which good results may be obtained. The
specifications will be for only one instrument;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
though of course two instruments made alike will
be necessary for any purposes of speaking or
other signals.</p>

</div>

<p>Procure three common horse-shoe magnets
about six inches long, all of the same size; these
retail in the market at about a dollar apiece.
They should be strong enough to hold up several
times their own weight each. Next, have turned
out of good hard wood,&mdash;such as maple or boxwood,&mdash;two
spools not over half an inch long
and an inch and a half broad, the sides cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
square both inside and out, as shown at S, Fig. <a href="#Fig_15">15</a>;
a hole the third of an inch in diameter is to be
made through the spool. Into this hole is to be
fitted a short rod of soft iron, I, about an inch
long, which should be a little rounded at the
outer end. The bobbins may be wound with as
much insulated copper wire as they will hold.
The wire may be from the one-fortieth to the one-fiftieth
of an inch in diameter, as is most convenient
to obtain, the latter size being preferable.
The resistance of such bobbins will probably be
from two to three ohms each. The soft-iron core I
must project backwards far enough to be clamped
between the two outer magnets 1 and 3, while the
inner one, 2, is drawn back. When the bobbins
are in their places, and are clamped between the
upper and lower magnets, they will stand as
shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig_16">16</a>, where the view is from above;
the magnets being buttoned down to the block
they rest on (see Fig. <a href="#Fig_17">17</a>), which at the same time
holds the soft-iron rods with the bobbins upon
them. The wires on these coils must be connected
in the same way they would be in order to
make opposite poles of their outer ends, if a current<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of electricity were to be sent through the
coils. An upright board B (Fig. <a href="#Fig_17">17</a>) six or seven
inches square, having a round hole four inches in
diameter cut out from the middle of it, must be
fixed near the end of the base-board; and over
this hole is to be screwed <i>tightly</i> a piece of thin
sheet iron or steel; it may be from the one-twentieth
to the one-fiftieth of an inch in thickness.
It does not seem to make much difference about
the thickness of this plate. I have generally got
the best results from a plate one-fiftieth of an inch
thick. The upright board carrying this plate
must be very rigid, otherwise the plate will be kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
tight to the magnets all the time; and one of
the conditions of success in working is, that this
plate shall be as close as possible to the magnet-ends,
but not to touch: therefore fix the
board tight, and adjust the magnets by means of
the button shown on top of them in the perspective
figure.</p>

<p>The sounds to be transmitted, of whatever sort
they may be, are to be made on the side P, Fig. <a href="#Fig_16">16</a>; and likewise, when the instrument is used as
a receiver, the ear is to be applied at the same
place. A tube about two inches in diameter may
be made fast to the front of the board, in a line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with the centre of the plate; this will aid somewhat
in hearing. When two or three persons are
to sing, it will be best to have each one supplied
with a tube to sing through; one end of the tube
to be placed close to the front of the plate. The
sound of musical instruments, such as the flute
and the cornet, will be reproduced much louder,
if the front of such instrument be allowed to rest
upon the rim of the hole in the board, just in
front of the plate.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that low talking can be heard
more distinctly than when a great effort is made;
but the sounds though distinct are not strong at
any time, and other sounds seriously interfere
with hearing. It is probable that some way will
hereafter be devised for increasing the usefulness
of the invention by increasing the volume of
sound. On account of the weakness of the sound
it becomes necessary to provide a call to attract
the attention of one in the room. This may be
accomplished by having a small electric bell
worked by a one or two cell battery. Another
way which I have found to be quite as efficient
is to have a rod of iron or steel about a foot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
long, and half an inch in diameter, bent into a U
form. When this is held by the bend, and struck
upon the floor or with a stick, it vibrates powerfully;
and if one of its prongs be permitted to
strike against the plate P, Fig. <a href="#Fig_16">16</a>, the sound
will be reproduced loud enough to hear over a
large room. I have never failed to call with this
when any one was in the same room with the
telephone.</p>

<p>Wherever a telephone circuit has been made
upon telegraph poles having other wires upon
them, the inductive actions of the currents upon
the other wires has been found to seriously interfere
with the action of the telephones, inasmuch
as the latter reproduce every other message.
One skilled in reading by sound in the ordinary
way can read through the telephone what message
is travelling in a neighboring wire. Messages
may be thus read upon wires as far distant
as ten feet from the telephone circuit. It there
fore seems to be essential that each telephone
circuit should be isolated from every other one,
else there can be no secrecy in messages.</p>

<p>A very interesting effect was noticed one night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
when there was a bright aurora display. There
was a continuous current through the wires,
accompanied with sounds which increased in
intensity as the bright streamers passed by.
This will probably lead to some important results
in science.</p>

<p>In all probability the telephone is as much in
its infancy as was ordinary telegraphy in 1840.
Since that time the sciences of electricity and
magnetism have had the most of their growth,
and telegraphy has kept pace with the advancing
knowledge until its commercial importance is
second to no other agency. Very many important
principles that are invaluable in telegraphy
to-day were wholly unknown in 1840; but it may
here be noted that in the telephone, as it now is,
there is not a single principle that was not well
enough known in 1840. This will be apparent
to one who follows out the phenomena from the
sender to the receiver. First, the sound in air
causing a corresponding movement in a solid
body, iron. This iron, acting inductively upon a
magnet, originates magneto-electric currents in a
wire helix about it; and these travel to another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
helix, and, re-acting upon the magnet in it, have
electro-magnetic effects, and increase and decrease
the strength of the magnet; and this variable
magnetism affects the plate of iron in front
of that magnet, and makes it to vibrate in a corresponding
manner, and thus to restore to the air
in one place the vibrations absorbed from the air
in another place. To some it may seem strange
that a simple thing as the telephone is, involving
nothing but principles familiar enough to every
one interested in physical science, should have
waited nearly forty years to be invented. The
reason is probably this: Men of science, as a
rule, do not feel called upon to apply the principles
which they may discover. They are content
to be <i>discovering</i>, not <i>inventing</i>. Now, the
schools of the country ought to make the youth
quite familiar with the general principles of
physical science, that the inventive ones&mdash;and
there are many such&mdash;may apply them intelligently.
Mechanism is all that stands between
us and a&euml;rial navigation; all that is necessary to
reproduce human speech in writing; and all that
is needed to realize completely the prophetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
picture of the "Graphic," of the orator who shall
at the same instant address an audience in every
city in the world.</p>
